Due to this, and the fact that salaries tend to be very good, I think a portion of people making the switch might be doing it for the wrong reasons. \\n\\nAnd once you get into that career, as a Junior it can often be difficult to know what you should be doing to advance your career. There are a ton of opinions out there (including mine) and juniors tend to develop a lot of misconceptions, as my colleague and I discussed in our recent [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/112im2m/senior_devs_what_are_the_most_damaging/) and [follow-up video](/blog/2023/02/21/junior-developer-misconceptions).\\n\\nSo, I put together this list of things you should consider when starting out a career in tech: \\n\\n1. \ud83d\udc4e **If you\u2019re doing it solely for the money, you\u2019re not gonna make it.** True, you don\u2019t need a degree or anyone\u2019s permission to advance in this career, but you need ambition and mental stamina. A genuine interest is needed to maintain them. \\n\\n2. \ud83d\ude0e\xa0**You don\u2019t have to follow the trends. Follow what interests you.** Like I said before, you need mental stamina in this field of work. Following your interests will keep you engaged and help avoid burnout.\\n\\n3. \ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\udcbb\xa0**You don\u2019t need to know a piece of tech inside and out,** contrary to what some devs might want you to believe. The truth is, you are always learning, and there will always be gaps in your knowledge. Your confidence in being able to fill those gaps is what matters.\\n\\n4. \ud83e\uddf1\xa0**Start building, ASAP.** Find a problem that interests you and build the solution yourself. Contribute to Open-Source projects that you use. A portfolio of unique work speaks volumes about your abilities. Plus, there\u2019s no better teacher than experience. \\n\\n5. \ud83d\ude31\xa0**Be fearless and seek feedback.** Put your work out there and be ready to have it criticized. If you can stomach it, you\u2019ll come out the other side a much better developer. \\n\\n6. \ud83e\uddd0\xa0**You should have a firm understanding of what you\u2019re doing.** Don\u2019t copy-paste someone else\u2019s answer (or GPT\u2019s) to your problem and call it a day. Question why things work, and figure it out for yourself.\\n\\n7. \ud83c\udfcb\ufe0f\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\xa0**You have to do the grunt work, unfortunately. Don\u2019t expect high salaries from the beginning.** And you\u2019ll probably want to improve your portfolio by working on side projects in your free time, or you might stay a junior dev for longer than you wish. \\n\\n8. \ud83e\uddd7\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\xa0**Challenge yourself. Don\u2019t let yourself get too comfortable.** If you do, you won\u2019t improve. Offer to take new, difficult, and daunting tasks at work or with your personal projects. You\u2019ll be surprised what you can achieve. \\n\\n9. \ud83d\udcb0\xa0**You don\u2019t have to pay for boot camps or courses.** In fact, you\u2019re better off tackling problems on your own and only asking for help if you\u2019re truly stuck. There\u2019s a wealth of free resources out there, and when you\u2019re on the job, these might be the only things to assist you.\\n\\n10. \ud83d\udde3\xa0**Programming is definitely not the only skill you\u2019ll need.** Being respectful, communicative, conscientious, ambitious, and humble will put you in a different league and make you a valuable asset in any tech team. \\n\\nTIP: *Looking for some inspiration?

The main purpose is to keep development velocity high which benefits all stakeholders* \\n> &nbsp; \u2014 **zoechi**\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\nWe recently asked the web dev community on [Reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/112im2m/senior_devs_what_are_the_most_damaging/) what the most common misconceptions are amongst junior developers, and we got a ton of great responses -- more than 270 to be exact.\\n\\nBecause there was so much to discuss, Matija and I decided to summarize the replies and give our own opinions in a longer-form YouTube video, which you can watch below. \\n\\n*You can also continue reading further for a summary of the main concepts.*\\n\\n<iframe width=\\"100%\\" height=\\"400\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/eermNn9VhOA\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n<p></p>\\n\\n## The Most Common Themes\\n\\nAmong the responses were lots of great, specific examples, but we noticed a lot of common themes within them:\\n\\n- **Code Quality**\\n- **Managing Time & Expectations**\\n- **Effective Communication & Teamwork**\\n\\nThese seemed to be the topics senior devs had the most to say about. And it makes sense -- these are the things that, when you get to the core of the issues, can make or break almost *any* career. \\n\\nIt was also interesting to see that the top replies were issues that encompassed all of these themes. For example, take the top-voted reply:\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"Clean it up later\\"\\n    source=\\"img/junior-misconceptions/come-back-later.png\\"\\n    caption=\\"The most common misconception is that you\'re going to come back and clean that up later.\\" \\n/>\\n\\n## First Quality & Then Velocity\\n\\nThe top reply above touches on all three of the common themes we outlined, because within it is a message about quality -- about doing things correctly. And whenever you speak about quality, there is an inherent assumption that it takes longer, so we\'re also talking about time management. And, if you\'re a part of a team, you can\'t work effectively without good communication and teamwork.\\n\\nNevertheless, in the \\"quality\\" debate there were effectively two camps, with those who thought quality code was about: \\n 1. writing clean, readable code, that\'s easy to maintain \\n 2. writing code that gets shipped on time and works.\\n\\nThe balance between meeting deadlines, shipping features, and writing the best possible code is obviously a tricky one to get right. Some people had the opinion that business realities trump clean code patterns in the dash to meet deadlines and keep clients happy, while others thought that clean, quality code should be the priority, and that by making it a priority you can actually increase long-term velocity, even if short-term deadlines aren\'t met.\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"You don\'t have to touch all the code you see\\"\\n    source=\\"img/junior-misconceptions/touch-all-code.png\\"\\n/>\\n\\nThis discussion can distract from Junior developers priorities though, which are to grow and improve as a developer, not lead the team to success. Therefore, it\'s probably best for Junior devs to focus on quality first, and then improve their speed of delivery second.\\n\\n## Stay Humble & Manage Expectations\\n\\nAs a Junior developer, it\'s not expected that you\'re going to get everything right the first time. There is an assumption that you will learn the best practices over time, and along the way you might produce inconsistent work, make mistakes, or even possibly break some things along the way.\\n\\nBut that\'s okay. \\n\\nIt\'s part of the process. It\'s expected. And it\'s important to remember that this is not a reflection of your value or worth as an engineer or individual. \\n\\nIn the replies, there were also many developers who recognized another developer\'s desire \\"to fix things later\\" as a way to brush off criticism towards their work. They generally viewed this as a bad habit to get into, as it is often one that plagues developers even as they gain more experience. \\"Code reviews are not personal\\", and being able to take criticism graciously is an important skill to develop. After all, seniors are there to guide you towards making better decisions based on their own experiences. And juniors are there to learn.\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"The senior dev doesn\'t know everything\\"\\n    source=\\"img/junior-misconceptions/senior-knows-all.png\\"\\n/>\\n\\nBut how often should you seek a Senior\'s advice? Should you do what they said, or what some dude told you *is the only way to do x* on YouTube or in some blogpost ;) ? \\n\\nShould you ask for help every time you get stuck, or should you compromise your sanity and struggle alone for days?\\n\\nWell, it depends on who you ask. But most of the replies made it clear that:\\n1. You should try it out yourself first.\\n2. Use the resources available to you (Google, Stack Overflow, GPT) to try and figure it out.\\n3. Ask for help once you considerably slow down on making any progress.\\n4. If you have a possible solution and it differs from the senior dev\'s suggestion, that doesn\'t mean it\'s wrong -- there can sometimes be many possible ways to achieve the same goal!\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"Bothering seniors with questions\\"\\n    source=\\"img/junior-misconceptions/bothering-questions.png\\"\\n/>\\n\\n## Be Flexibile & Open to Change \\n\\nNothing changes faster than the world of technology. As a developer, you need to constantly be learning and adapting to new technologies and trends. If you don\'t like change, well then being a software developer probably isn\'t the right career for you.\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"Everything takes longer than you think\\"\\n    source=\\"img/junior-misconceptions/everything-takes-longer.png\\"\\n/>\\n\\nOn top of things changing constantly, it\'s the kind of job that challenges your assumptions. What you think might be the best solution turns out to be incompatible with your team\'s desired goals or end product, and you\'re forced to use a \\"sub-optimal\\" solution instead. Why? Because it\'s the best way to \\nget the job done given your team\'s constraints. *\\"Sorry, pal, but we can\'t use your favorite framework on this one.\\"*\\n\\nThe developers who stay flexible and open-minded are often at an advantage here.

In this interview, he tells how sometimes the best ideas come looking for you, and how moving quickly can help you stay inspired, motivated, and pull in your first satisfied customers.\\n\\n<br/>\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"Amicus Homepage\\"\\n    source=\\"/img/amicus-usecase/amicus-homepage.png\\"\\n    width=\\"500px\\"\\n/>\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n<hr/>\\n\\n### Before we begin with the unlikely origin story of Amicus.work, can you tell us a bit about what it is?\\n\\n[Amicus](https://amicus.work) is a SaaS tool for legal teams that helps keep you organized and on top of your legal needs. Think of it like \\"Asana for lawyers\\", but with features and workflows tailored to the domain of law. \\n\\nIt allows attorneys and their clients to easily track the progress of the legal case they are dealing with, and collaborate with others involved in the case, all in one central location. For example, deadline reminders help with not missing key dates and workflow visualization allows lawyer and client to see where the process is stuck, and get it unstuck.\\n\\n\\n### Your time from initial idea to working MVP seemed fast. How long was it and how did you achieve it so quickly?\\n\\nFrom the initial discussions to the launch of the initial prototype was probably a week or so. This is even quicker than it sounds because I was working a full time job at the time. The speed [of execution] was fully enabled by [Wasp](https://wasp-lang.dev), a full-stack web app framework.\\n\\nI was looking at other solutions, but none of them were full-stack and sounded like a lot of work just to stitch everything together and get started. I just wanted to get the job done and didn\u2019t care about picking the stack specifics myself. [Wasp](https://wasp-lang.dev) was really helpful as it set me up with the best practices and I had everything running in just a few minutes!\\n\\n### How were you able to get these first customers so quickly?\\n\\nThe first user is a little bit of a cheat because I know them \u2014 my brother, who is a lawyer. But having read about other entrepreneurs, this is not that uncommon. Sometimes the first users we know are ourselves, sometimes they\u2019re family or friends, and sometimes it\u2019s someone you sought out. But I think it was important to have the client before the idea, because that way you have the problem before the solution.\\n\\n### What advice would you give to other Solopreneurs regarding the validation process?\\n\\nWith regard to process, I spent a lot of time having discussions with my first user - my brother. The better you know the first user, the more careful you need to be I think. They\u2019re going to give you slack and support your ideas. You don\u2019t really want that, so you have to dive deeper into each problem/solution - like asking 5 why\u2019s, so you can be more objective. \\n\\nOnce more users came on, I began sending out surveys about the key things I wanted to know. I also started setting up SQL queries and adding logs to answer questions about what kind of user was using what features the most etc. Being a solopreneur means you have to be even more careful about what you spend your time building.\\n\\nMRR is low at the moment, around ~$90, and the first goal is to get to an MRR around ~$2,000. At that point I would be able to throw more time and resources at the application, increase the utility, and kick off a virtuous cycle of more revenue and utility.\\n\\n### That\u2019s great. So rather than trying to find a clever idea, the idea found you.\\n\\nIt\u2019s funny because I have all of these harebrained ideas that I\u2019m always kicking around, thinking about how to validate them: MVPs, setting up a landing page that gets emails or deposits, etc. \\n\\nMeanwhile my brother was telling me about this pain of managing matters that no tool really helped with. Clients want to know where the process is, how many steps are left, how they need to be reminded of important dates like contract deadlines, etc. So I agreed to build something to see if it would help. [Wasp](https://wasp-lang.dev) was instrumental here because if these steps had taken too long I would have probably lost interest and gotten distracted by something else. It allowed me to abstract all the details of a full stack app and focus on the product itself.\\n\\nI built the prototype and it was TERRIBLE, it hurts to think back on that first version. But it was being used, and terrible though it was, it was still providing utility. And that was the point where it clicked the idea would work - if my first crude attempt was useful, and it would only get better with each iteration, there is a space here to provide so much value that some of it can be captured.\\n\\nI guess it was less me having an idea and validating it, and more a valid idea coming to me and biting me in the ass, and me thinking \u2018oh hey\u2026\u2019.\\n\\n### What\u2019s been the biggest lessons learned as a result from building Amicus? If you could do it over, what would you do the same and what would you do differently?\\n\\nI think one of the things I would do differently is spend a little more time at the beginning getting a full grasp on the use cases. I tried doing this with interviews with the first client. However once what was intended was built, I come across all of these questions that weren\u2019t initially obvious. I have seen PMs in the past create paper mockups (or using [Figma](https://www.figma.com) if there is time) and walking a person through what they would do - then all of a sudden these assumptions you both had bubble up. [I] would probably do something like that if possible.\\n\\n### What were your biggest concerns before getting started building Amicus? What problems did you know you wanted to avoid and how did you successfully achieve those goals?\\n\\n[My] biggest concern when getting started building [Amicus](https://amicus.work) was honestly that it would go to the unfinished project graveyard. Once again, [Wasp](https://wasp-lang.dev) was key to resolving this. Being able to remove most of the redundancy involved in making a full stack app really helped me. It allowed me to focus on the interesting problems.\\n\\nOne of the things I have been trying to be careful to avoid is building things that aren\u2019t needed or solving problems that don\u2019t exist. It is very easy to get into the trap of thinking \u2018oh this would be cool\u2019 or \u2018oh this extra thing might need to be build incase\u2026\u2019. I have been trying to be rigorous about validating features before building them (by talking to users or through the surveys), and unless theres a good reason to believe something is a problem I don\u2019t spend my time fixing it. This is very hard, but it has allowed me to focus.\\n\\n<br/>\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"Wasp Logo\\"\\n    source=\\"/img/wasp-logo-wide.png\\"\\n    width=\\"500px\\"\\n/>\\n\\n### Have you done any form of advertising? press releases? How are you spreading the word about Amicus at the moment?\\n\\nNo advertising yet and no press releases either. Right now spreading of the word is mostly through word of mouth. Advertising can be a money pit, especially when you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing (and I probably don\u2019t know what I am doing) so I want to first make sure I am at the point where users feel passionate enough about Amicus to where they tell others about it. Once I get there, advertising can have a bigger return even with my fumbling. \\n\\n### What made you decide to go it alone as a \u201cSolopreneur\u201d? Were you confident that you\u2019d be able to tackle the challenge alone, and if so why?\\n\\nThis wasn\u2019t so much a decision as something that came about one decision at a time. What initially started as just a handy app for my brother to use, naturally grew in scope and utility, and all of a sudden there was a business and I effectively became a solopreneur. Although I\u2019ve always wanted to be an entrepreneur, I didn\u2019t realize I had become a solopreneur until after the fact.\\n\\n<hr/>\\n\\n*Want to stay in the loop? \u2192 [Join our newsletter!](/#signup)*"},{"id":"/2023/02/02/no-best-framework","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2023/02/02/no-best-framework","editUrl":"https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/edit/main/web/blog/blog/2023-02-02-no-best-framework.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-02-02-no-best-framework.md","title":"The Best Web App Framework Doesn\'t Exist","description":"The web app framework you choose doesn\u2019t really matter.

Well, it matters, just not as much as others would like you to believe. \\n\\nThe fact that so many libraries and frameworks exist in 2023, and that **the best one** is [still hotly debated](https://joshcollinsworth.com/blog/self-fulfilling-prophecy-of-react), proves my point. It\u2019s the web developers biggest \u201cfirst-world problem\u201d \u2014 a problem that\u2019s not really a problem. On Maslow\u2019s *Hierarchy of Developer Needs,* it\u2019s definitely near the top (ok, I made that up \ud83d\ude05)\\n\\n<br/>\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"hierarchy of developer needs\\"\\n    source=\\"img/best-framework/hierarchy-of-dev-needs.png\\"\\n/>\\n<br/>\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nFor example, according the the [StateOfJS](https://2022.stateofjs.com/en-US/libraries/front-end-frameworks/) survey, there were 5 Front-end Frameworks with good retention in 2018, now there are 11 in 2022. That\u2019s a 120% increase in a matter of 4 years, and that\u2019s not even taking into account the hot meta-frameworks like NextJS, SvelteKit, or Astro!\\n\\n<br/>\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"State of JS 2022\\"\\n    source=\\"img/best-framework/state-of-js.png\\"\\n    caption=\\"A growing family of frameworks...\\"\\n/>\\n<br/>\\n\\nThese are great developments for the space, overall. They improve things like developer speed, bundle size, performance, and developer experience. But they also make it damn hard for developers and teams to make a decision when trying to decide which to use for their next project. It\u2019s even worse for beginners, which is probably why they just go for React \u2014 which, of course, is perfectly fine. \\n\\nAnd I think all of this is OK, because in the end it doesn\u2019t really matter which one you choose. When it really comes down to it, all that matters is that the framework you chose:\\n\\n- Is stable\\n- Allows you to move quickly\\n- Allows you to reach your end goal\\n\\nWhy? Because most of them are built around the same concepts, have proven themselves capable of performing at scale, and have communities you can engage with and learn from. \\n\\nReact might be the most prominent in job descriptions, but if you\u2019re looking for a new role and only have experience in Vue or Angular, I can\u2019t imagine it would take you more than a week to build a side-project with React to display your ability to prospective employers.\\n\\nOn the flip side, if you\u2019re a beginner or Junior dev, once you have the basics of HTML, CSS, and JS under your belt, it doesn\u2019t really matter what framework you learn. I personally started learning backend development with Node/ExpressJS, but landed my first role as a Frontend developer with Angular. In my second role I used NextJS, and now I work with [Wasp](https://wasp-lang.dev) (a full-stack framework built on top of React and ExpressJS). [Developers never stop learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gl5HvBpUbt8), so it\u2019s kind of a non-argument to deride any specific framework \u2014 unless it really sucks, but then no one will continue to use it anyway.\\n\\n<br/>\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"Use what works\\"\\n    source=\\"img/best-framework/midwitwasp.jpeg\\"\\n/>\\n<br/>\\n\\nSo, in the end, use what works. Because in 99.99% of cases, your choice of web framework will not decide the fate of your project.\\n\\nIf you\u2019ve done a bit of research and found a framework that suits your needs and you enjoy using it \u2014 use it. There\u2019s really no good reason not to.\\n\\n<br/>\\n<hr/>\\n\\n*Want to stay in the loop? \u2192 [Join our newsletter!](/#signup)*"},{"id":"/2023/01/31/wasp-beta-launch-review","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2023/01/31/wasp-beta-launch-review","editUrl":"https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/edit/main/web/blog/blog/2023-01-31-wasp-beta-launch-review.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-01-31-wasp-beta-launch-review.md","title":"Convincing developers to try a new web framework - the effects of launching beta","description":"<ImgWithCaption","date":"2023-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"January 31, 2023","tags":[{"label":"webdev","permalink":"/blog/tags/webdev"},{"label":"wasp","permalink":"/blog/tags/wasp"},{"label":"startups","permalink":"/blog/tags/startups"},{"label":"github","permalink":"/blog/tags/github"}],"readingTime":6.455,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Matija Sosic","title":"Co-founder & CEO @ Wasp","url":"https://github.com/matijasos","imageURL":"https://github.com/matijasos.png","key":"matijasos"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Convincing developers to try a new web framework - the effects of launching beta","authors":["matijasos"],"image":"/img/beta-launch-review/how-it-started.png","tags":["webdev","wasp","startups","github"]},"prevItem":{"title":"The Best Web App Framework Doesn\'t Exist","permalink":"/blog/2023/02/02/no-best-framework"},"nextItem":{"title":"Wasp Beta December 2022","permalink":"/blog/2023/01/18/wasp-beta-update-dec"}},"content":"import Link from \'@docusaurus/Link\';\\nimport useBaseUrl from \'@docusaurus/useBaseUrl\';\\n\\nimport InBlogCta from \'./components/InBlogCta\';\\nimport WaspIntro from \'./_wasp-intro.md\';\\nimport ImgWithCaption from \'./components/ImgWithCaption\'\\n\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"Alpha feedback\\"\\n    source=\\"img/beta-launch-review/how-it-started.png\\"\\n/>\\n\\nWe are developing an OSS web framework in a form of a config language (DSL) that works with React & Node.js. Getting developers to use a new tool (especially a web framework) is [a pretty hard thing to do](/blog/2022/09/29/journey-to-1000-gh-stars). We wished there were more stories of how today\'s mainstream tools got adopted that we could learn from, so that motivated us to document our own.\\n\\n*Want to stay in the loop? \u2192 [Join our newsletter!](/#signup)*\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## TL;DR\\n- [HackerNews launch](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33910997) post brought the most traffic, by far\\n- Product Hunt launch went worse than expected, bots took over\\n- Our goal was to reach GitHub Trending but we failed\\n- Less overall traffic than for the Alpha launch, but much higher quality of feedback + a shift in public perception\\n- Having a public launch date made us 3x more productive\\n\\n## \ud83d\udcca The results: stats\\nWe [launched Beta](/blog/2022/11/29/wasp-beta) on Nov 27, 2022 in a launch week format, recently popularized by [Supabase](https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-how-we-launch). During the first week we launched on Product Hunt, and after the weekend we posted on HackerNews. Here\'s what the numbers were on the last day of the launch:\\n- 190 GitHub stars added to the repo\\n- 108 new projects started\\n- 83 new users (installed Wasp locally and ran it)\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"Web visitors during beta launch week\\"\\n    source=\\"img/beta-launch-review/launch-week-visitors.png\\"\\n/>\\n\\nHN launch caused almost 2x spike in traffic and usage. Also, although our launch week already ended by the start of December, we actually had the most users ever throughout December:\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"WAU displayed monthly\\"\\n    source=\\"img/beta-launch-review/wau-monthly.png\\"\\n/>\\n\\nLooking back, this wasn\'t at all our biggest event in terms of traffic, but it was in terms of usage:\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"All time stats\\"\\n    source=\\"img/beta-launch-review/all-time-stats.png\\"\\n/>\\n\\nOne of the main effects of the launch (together with a [few](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32098144) [recent](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32566123) successful HN posts, and the [Alpha Testing Program](/blog/2022/11/16/alpha-testing-program-post-mortem) we ran in Jul \'22) is that we managed to move the baseline WAU from ~10 to ~20. Another effect, felt more subjectively, is the change in the community perception.\\n\\n## Community perception shift\\nAs mentioned above, although our Alpha launch had higher absolute numbers (website traffic, HN upvotes etc), **it felt that Beta launch caused the biggest perception shift in the community so far**.\\n\\nBefore were mostly getting superficial comments like *\u201cthis looks cool, I\u2019ll give it a try once\u201d*, or *\u201cwhy DSL approach and not the other one\u201d*, and this time we could notice that portion of people already knew Wasp from before (some even used it), and had more specific questions, even proposing next features that we planned but haven\u2019t published yet.\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"Beta feedback\\"\\n    source=\\"img/beta-launch-review/beta-feedback.png\\"\\n/>\\n\\nAlthough the core message (DSL for developing full-stack web apps with React & Node.js) hasn\u2019t changed, there was significantly less pushback to the concept than before. I guess it comes down to the time elapsed and the product being more polished and validated from the outside - Beta, [published use-cases](/#showcases), [testimonials](/#testimonials), \u2026\\n\\n\\n## Before the launch\\nThis was our initial plan:\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"Launch timeline\\"\\n    source=\\"img/beta-launch-review/launch-timeline.png\\"\\n/>\\n\\nFor 20 days before the launch we were posting daily countdown banners on Twitter + a few polls (e.g. what\'s your favourite CSS framework) to engage the audience.\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"Examples of pre-launch tweets\\"\\n    source=\\"img/beta-launch-review/prelaunch-tweets.png\\"\\n/>\\n\\n[Our Twitter game](https://twitter.com/WaspLang) is still super young (~500 followers) so it didn\'t have a big effect but it helped to get the team excited and a few people also noticed it and commented/voted.\\n\\nDue to the lack of time we ended up doing user testing in-house. That\'s still something I\'d like to improve and make a habit of in the future.\\n\\nA few other things we did prior to the launch:\\n- **Redesigned our project page** - gave it a new, sleeker look\\n- **Published [use cases with our most successful users](/#showcases)** and featured them on the project page\\n- **Activated our Discord and [email list](https://us4.campaign-archive.com/?u=8139c7de74df98aa17054b235&id=1195fce664)**\\n- **Organized a launch event** (call on Discord) to celebrate the launch - it went better than expected, a decent amount of people showed up and we had some good discussions!\\n\\n## The launch\\nAs mentioned, we went with a launch week format - we liked the idea of having a whole week filled with content rather than cramming everything in a single day. We highlighted a new feature every day + launched a hackathon on the last day of the week, to keep the momentum. You can see the full schedule [here](/blog/2022/11/26/wasp-beta-launch-week).\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"Launch week schedule\\"\\n    source=\\"img/beta-launch-review/launch-schedule.png\\"\\n/>\\n\\nWe also shared our launch news at different places, most successful being [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/products/wasp-lang-alpha#wasp-lang-beta), [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33910997) and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/z7xo9t/wasp_dsl_framework_for_building_fullstack_js/).\\n\\n## Product Hunt - failed, but ok\\nThe mistake we did was launching on the Thanksgiving weekend - there was little (real) traffic + the mods were away so the bots took over!\\n\\nWe ended up as [#5 product of the day](https://www.producthunt.com/products/wasp-lang-alpha#wasp-lang-beta) with ~250 upvotes, which wasn\u2019t so bad because in the end we got featured in their daily newsletter with 1M+ subscribers.\\n\\nThe bad part was that mods were away and **pretty much all other products in front of us were fake or obviously bot powered!** It felt like there was no real interaction on any of these products, just endless \u201ccongrats on the launch\u201d comments from the newly created accounts with obviously fake names. Two products were also clearly violating PH rules (one was the same product that launched a week or two ago, but just changed the name).\\n\\nThe most disappointing part for us (and especially for the team) was that it felt like there aren\u2019t any real people on PH, just bots.\\n\\n## \ud83d\udd79 Post-launch: Wasp Hackathon #1 - Betathon!\\nSince we introduced all the new features during the launch week, we thought a good way to keep the community engaged and give them a reason to try Wasp Beta out would be to throw a hackathon! It was the first time we did so we weren\'t sure how it\'d go, but it went better than expected!\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"Tweet about Betathon - our #1 hackathon!\\"\\n    source=\\"img/beta-launch-review/hackathon-tweet.png\\"\\n/>\\n\\nIn the end, it was definitely worth it ([see review and submissions here](https://wasp-lang.dev/blog/2023/01/11/betathon-review)). It was quite lightweight to organize (we even made a [custom web app with Wasp for the hackathon](https://betathon.wasp-lang.dev/) which you can also [use for your hackathon](https://github.com/vincanger/wasp-betathon)) and we got some really nice submissions and community shout-outs.\\n\\n## Announcing a launch date publicly is great for productivity\\n\\nAnother big benefit we noticed from this type of launching is how much more productive it made the whole team. Although the launch date was totally self-imposed (and we did move it a couple of times internally), it was still an amazing forcing function once we announced it publicly. It focused the efforts of the whole team and it also felt great.\\n\\n**We decided to keep going with the quarterly release schedule in this format - 3 months is just enough time to make a dent on the product side, but not long enough to get stuck or caught up with endless refactoring**. It also forces us to plan for the features that will have most impact on the developers using Wasp and make their lives easier, because we all want to have something cool and useful to present during the launch week.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nI hope you found this post helpful or at least interesting! Creating a new web framework might be one of the most notorious things to do as a developer, but that shouldn\'t be a reason not to do it - where are the new frameworks going to come from otherwise?\\n\\n*Want to stay in the loop? \u2192 [Join our newsletter!](/#signup)*"},{"id":"/2023/01/18/wasp-beta-update-dec","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2023/01/18/wasp-beta-update-dec","editUrl":"https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/edit/main/web/blog/blog/2023-01-18-wasp-beta-update-dec.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-01-18-wasp-beta-update-dec.md","title":"Wasp Beta December 2022","description":"<ImgWithCaption","date":"2023-01-18T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"January 18, 2023","tags":[{"label":"webdev","permalink":"/blog/tags/webdev"},{"label":"wasp","permalink":"/blog/tags/wasp"},{"label":"startups","permalink":"/blog/tags/startups"},{"label":"github","permalink":"/blog/tags/github"}],"readingTime":5.095,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Matija Sosic","title":"Co-founder & CEO @ Wasp","url":"https://github.com/matijasos","imageURL":"https://github.com/matijasos.png","key":"matijasos"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Wasp Beta December 2022","authors":["matijasos"],"image":"/img/update-dec-23/banner.png","tags":["webdev","wasp","startups","github"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Convincing developers to try a new web framework - the effects of launching beta","permalink":"/blog/2023/01/31/wasp-beta-launch-review"},"nextItem":{"title":"Hosting Our First Hackathon: Results & Review","permalink":"/blog/2023/01/11/betathon-review"}},"content":"import Link from \'@docusaurus/Link\';\\nimport useBaseUrl from \'@docusaurus/useBaseUrl\';\\n\\nimport InBlogCta from \'./components/InBlogCta\';\\nimport WaspIntro from \'./_wasp-intro.md\';\\nimport ImgWithCaption from \'./components/ImgWithCaption\'\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"Wasp Update Dec 22\\"\\n    source=\\"img/update-dec-23/banner.png\\"\\n/>\\n\\n*Want to stay in the loop? \u2192 [Join our newsletter!](/#signup)*\\n\\nHey Wasp tribe \ud83d\udc1d ,\\n\\nHappy New Year!

Let\'s dive in and see what\'s new and what\'s in the plans for this year:\\n\\n## \ud83c\udfae \ud83d\udc1d We hosted our first hackathon - it was a blast! \ud83c\udf89 \ud83c\udf89\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"Tweet about Wasp\\"\\n    source=\\"img/update-dec-23/tskaggs-tweet.png\\"\\n/>\\n\\nWe launched our first Wasp hackathon ever on the last day of Beta Launch (thus we named it Betathon) and got some [really cool submissions](/blog/2023/01/11/betathon-review)!

It\'s a relatively new service by GitHub that allows distinguishing between specific, well-defined issues (bug reports, TODOs, ...) and discussion items (ideating about new features, figuring out best practices, etc) and allows for upvotes from the community.\\n\\nIf there is a feature you\'d like to see in Wasp (e.g. support for Vue) you can create a new post for it or upvote it if it is already there!\\n\\n## \ud83d\ude80 Next launch is coming - a super early sneak peek \ud83d\udc40 \\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"Next launch sneak peek\\"\\n    source=\\"img/update-dec-23/next-launch.png\\"\\n/>\\n\\nWe know we just wrapped up Beta release, but we are busy wasps and our heads are already in the next one! We made a preliminary draft of the features that are going to be included - **the \\"theme\\" of this release is going to be about making Wasp super easy and friendly for you to use**.\\n\\nWe\'ll further polish our auth & deployment experience, along with ensuring TypeScript experience is fully typed and as helpful as possible.

Being admirers of the work and style of Supabase, we drew a lot of inspiration from their \u201c[launch week](https://supabase.com/blog/launch-week-5-hackathon)\u201d approach when preparing for our own Beta launch and hacakthon.\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"Wasp Betathon Homepage\\"\\n    source=\\"img/betathon/betathonpage.png\\"\\n    caption=\\"Our dedicated hackathon landing page w/ intro video & submission form\\"\\n/>\\n\\nWith some good inspiration in hand, we set off to create a simple, easy-going Hackathon experience. We weren\u2019t certain we\u2019d get many participants, so we decided to make the process as open as possible: *two weeks to work on any project using Wasp, alone or in a team of up to 4 people, submitted on our [Betathon Homepage](https://betathon.wasp-lang.dev/) before the deadline*. That was it.\\n\\nWhen you\u2019re an early-stage startup, you can\u2019t offer big cash prizes, so we asked Railway if they\u2019d be interested in sponsoring some prizes, as we\u2019re big fans of their deployment and hosting platform. Luckily, they agreed (thanks, Railway \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude82). It was also a great match, since we already had the documentation for deploying Wasp apps to Railway on our website, making it an obvious choice for the participants to deploy their Hackathon apps with.\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"Keyboard\\"\\n    source=\\"img/betathon/keyboard.png\\"\\n    caption=\\"Disclaimer: actual prize keyboard will be cooler and waspier \ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\udc1d\\"\\n/>\\n\\nOn top of that, we decided that a cool grand prize could be a Wasp-colored mechanical keyboard. Nothing fancy, but keyboards are an item a lot of programmers love. We also threw in some Wasp beanies and shirts, and stated that we\u2019d spotlight the winner\u2019s on our platforms and social media accounts. \\n\\n\\n## Promotion\\n\\nFor the Wasp Beta Launch Week, we were active and publicising Wasp on many platforms. We didn\u2019t outright promote the hackathon on those platforms, but we were getting a lot of incoming interest to our Website and Discord, so we made noise about it there. We posted banners on the homepage, and made announcements on Discord and Twitter that directed people to a [Beta Hacakthon homepage](https://betathon.wasp-lang.dev) we created.\\n\\nThe homepage was nice to have as a central spot for all the rules and relevant info. We also added a fun intro video to give the hackathon a more personal touch. I also think the effort put into making an intro video gives participants the feeling that they\u2019re entering into a serious contest and committing to something of substance.\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"Hackathon Wasp app repo\\"\\n    source=\\"img/betathon/github.png\\"\\n    caption=\\"Wanna host your own Hackathon? Use our template app!\\"\\n/>\\n\\nAs an extra bonus, we wrote the Betathon Homepage with Wasp, and put the [source code up on our GitHub](https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/tree/main/examples/hackathon). We thought it might inspire people to build with Wasp, using it as a guide while creating their own projects for the hackathon, plus it could be used by others in the future if they want to host their own hackathon. \ud83d\udcbb\\n\\n### The Response\\n\\nThe response overall was small but significant, considering Wasp\u2019s age. We were also extremely happy with the quality of the engagement. We had thirteen participants register overall, a nice number considering we only started promoting the hackathon on the day that we announced it (this is probably something we\u2019d do differently next time)!\\n\\nWe also asked participants for their feedback on participating in the Hackathon, and they were all pleased with the open, straight-forward approach we took, so we\u2019ll most likely be repeating this for future versions. Other good signs were the many comments that participants were eager to take part in our next hackathon, as well as some dedicated new community members, which makes it all the more motivating for us. \ud83d\udcaa\\n\\n---\\n\\n**A big THANK YOU again to all the participants for their hard work and feedback.

It\u2019s amazing.

But it\u2019s not a complicated language like Java or Python, it\u2019s more similar to SQL or JSON, so the learning curve is really quick (technically, it\u2019s a *Domain Specific Langauge* or *DSL*). \\n\\nCheck it out for yourself:\\n\\n```c\\n/* main.wasp */\\n\\napp todoApp {\\n  title: \\"ToDo App\\",/* visible in tab */\\n\\n  auth: {/* full-stack auth out-of-the-box */\\n    userEntity: User,\\n    externalAuthEntity: SocialLogin,\\n    methods: {\\n      usernameAndPassword: {},\\n      google: {}\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n\\nroute RootRoute { path: \\"/\\", to: MainPage }\\npage MainPage {\\n\\t/* import your React code */\\n  component: import Main from \\"@client/Main.js\\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\nWith this simple file above, Wasp will continually compile a truly full-stack web app for you, with a React front-end, and an ExpressJS server. You\u2019re free to then build out the important features yourself with React, NodeJS, Prisma, and react-query.\\n\\nThe great part is, you can probably understand the Wasp syntax without even referencing the docs. Which means AI can probably work with it easily as well.

This is helpful but just a start, and it will get much smarter in future versions!\\n:::\\n\\n## Bit of history: why are Language Servers cool\\n\\nYears ago, there was no standardized way to write something like Language Server for your language, instead, each language was doing something of its own, and then each editor/IDE would also implement its own layer of logic for using it, and that was a loooot of work that needed to be done for each editor!\\n\\nLuckily, Microsoft then came up with [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) - a standardized way of communicating between the \u201csmart\u201d part, implemented by language creators, and the editor/IDE part (language extension) that is using it. This enabled each editor to implement this logic for interacting with language servers only once, and then it can be used for any language server!\\n\\nThis is great for us, language creators, because it means that once we implement a language server for our language, most of the work is done, and the work we need to do per each editor is manageable.\\n\\nRight now WLS is used only by the [VSCode Wasp language extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wasp-lang.wasp), but thanks to the nature of the Language Server Protocol, it should be relatively easy to add support for other editors too! Check this [GH issue](https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/issues/864) if you are interested in helping.\\n\\n## Setup\\n\\nThe best thing: there is nothing you, as a Wasp user, have to do to set up WLS! It already comes bundled with your installation of `wasp` \u2192 so if you can run `wasp` projects on your machine, you already have WLS, and it is always of the correct version needed for your current wasp installation. The only thing you need to ensure is you have `wasp` version \u2265 0.6, and a relatively fresh VSCode Wasp language extension.\\n\\nAn easy way to check that your version of `wasp` has WLS packaged into it is to run it and look at its usage instructions: it should mention `waspls` as one of the commands.\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"\\"\\n    source=\\"img/beta-ide-improvements/wasp-cli-waspls.png\\"\\n/>\\n\\n# Wasp VSCode extension\\n\\nIf we would call Wasp Language Server (WLS) the \u201cbackend\u201d, then [VSCode Wasp language extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wasp-lang.wasp) would be \u201cfrontend\u201d \u2192 it takes care of everything to ensure you have a nice experience working with Wasp in VSCode, while delegating the hardest work to the WLS.\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"\\"\\n    source=\\"img/beta-ide-improvements/wasp-vscode-extension.png\\"\\n/>\\n\\n:::tip\\nFor curious, you can check out its source code here, core of it is just one file: [https://github.com/wasp-lang/vscode-wasp/blob/main/src/extension.ts](https://github.com/wasp-lang/vscode-wasp/blob/main/src/extension.ts)\\n:::\\n\\n## Features\\n\\n### Syntax highlighting\\n\\nNothing unexpected here: it recognizes different parts of Wasp syntax, like type, value, identifier, comment, string, \u2026 and colors them appropriately.\\n\\nIf you are curious how is this implemented, check [https://github.com/wasp-lang/vscode-wasp/blob/main/syntaxes/wasp.tmLanguage.yaml](https://github.com/wasp-lang/vscode-wasp/blob/main/syntaxes/wasp.tmLanguage.yaml) \u2192 the whole syntax of Wasp is described via this \u201cmysterious\u201d old TextMate format, since that is the way to do it in VSCode.\\n\\n### Snippets\\n\\nWasp allows you to quickly generate a snippet of code for a new `page`, `query`, `action`, or `entity`!\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"\\"\\n    source=\\"img/beta-ide-improvements/wls-snippets.gif\\"\\n/>\\n\\nCheck out our snippet definitions here: [https://github.com/wasp-lang/vscode-wasp/blob/main/snippets/wasp.json](https://github.com/wasp-lang/vscode-wasp/blob/main/snippets/wasp.json) . It is actually really easy, in VSCode, to define them and add new ones.\\n\\n### Live error reporting + autocompletion\\n\\nThis is done by delegating the work to WLS, as described above!\\n\\n# IDE support for Javascript / Typescript in Wasp project\\n\\nDue to how unique Wasp is in its approach, getting an IDE to provide all the usual features for Javascript / Typescript wasn\u2019t completely working, and instead, the IDE would get somewhat confused with the context in which files are and would for example not be able to offer \u201cgo to definition\u201d for some values, or would not know how to follow the import path.\\n\\nWith Wasp Beta this is now resolved! We resolved this by somewhat changing the structure of the Wasp project and also adding tsconfig.json files that provide IDE with the information needed to correctly analyze the JS/TS source files.\\n\\nTo learn more about Typescript support in Wasp Beta, check [this blog post](https://wasp-lang.dev/blog/2022/11/29/typescript-feature-announcement)!\\n\\n# What does the future hold?\\n\\nWhile Wasp Beta greatly improved IDE support for Wasp, there are still quite a few things we want to improve on:\\n\\n1. Smarter autocompletion via WLS.\\n    1. Right now it suggests any expression when you need an expression. In the future, we want it to know exactly what is the type of needed expression, and suggest only expressions of that type! So if I am in `route ... { to: <my_cursor_here> }`, then I want to see only `page`s among the suggested completions, not `queries` or `actions` or something else.\\n    2. Further, we would also like it to autocomplete on dictionary fields \u2192 so if I am in `route ... { <my_cursor_here> }`, it should offer me `path` and `to` as completions, as those are only valid fields in the `route` dictionary.\\n2. Extensions for other editors besides VSCode. Now that we have Wasp Language Server, these shouldn\u2019t be too hard to implement! This is also a great task for potential contributors: check this [GH issue](https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/issues/864) if you are interested.\\n3. Implement Wasp code formatter. We could make it a part of WLS, and then have the editor extension call it on save.\\n4. Improve support for PSL (Prisma Schema Language) in .wasp files.\\n\\nIf any of these sound interesting, feel free to join us on our [Github](https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp), or join the discussion on [Discord](https://discord.gg/rzdnErX)!"},{"id":"/2022/11/30/optimistic-update-feature-announcement","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2022/11/30/optimistic-update-feature-announcement","editUrl":"https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/edit/main/web/blog/blog/2022-11-30-optimistic-update-feature-announcement.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-11-30-optimistic-update-feature-announcement.md","title":"Feature Release Announcement - Wasp Optimistic Updates","description":"We\u2019re excited to announce that Wasp actions now feature native support for optimistic updates!","date":"2022-11-30T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"November 30, 2022","tags":[{"label":"webdev","permalink":"/blog/tags/webdev"},{"label":"wasp","permalink":"/blog/tags/wasp"},{"label":"feature","permalink":"/blog/tags/feature"},{"label":"optimistic","permalink":"/blog/tags/optimistic"},{"label":"updates","permalink":"/blog/tags/updates"}],"readingTime":6.165,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Filip Sodi\u0107","title":"Founding Engineer @ Wasp","url":"https://github.com/sodic","imageURL":"https://github.com/sodic.png","key":"sodic"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Feature Release Announcement - Wasp Optimistic Updates","authors":["sodic"],"image":"/img/opt-updates-banner.png","tags":["webdev","wasp","feature","optimistic","updates"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Wasp Beta brings major IDE improvements","permalink":"/blog/2022/12/01/beta-ide-improvements"},"nextItem":{"title":"Permissions (access control) in web apps","permalink":"/blog/2022/11/29/permissions-in-web-apps"}},"content":"import Link from \'@docusaurus/Link\';\\nimport useBaseUrl from \'@docusaurus/useBaseUrl\';\\nimport InBlogCta from \'./components/InBlogCta\';\\nimport WaspIntro from \'./_wasp-intro.md\';\\nimport ImgWithCaption from \'./components/ImgWithCaption\'\\n\\nWe\u2019re excited to announce that Wasp actions now feature native support for optimistic updates!\\nContinue reading to to find out what optimistic updates are and how Wasp implements them.\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"Wasp TS support\\"\\n    source=\\"img/opt-updates-banner.png\\"\\n/>\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## What are Optimistic Updates Anyway?\\n\\nThink about an interactive web app you use daily. It could be almost anything (e.g., Reddit, Youtube, Facebook). It almost certainly features UI elements you can interact with without refreshing the page, such as upvotes on Reddit or likes on Youtube.\\n\\nAll these small actions play out in the same manner. Let\'s look at Reddit upvotes as an example:\\n\\n1. You click on the upvote button\\n2. Your browser sends a request to the server to save the upvote\\n3. The server saves your upvote to the database and sends a successful response to your browser\\n4. Your browser receives the successful response and reflects the change in the UI (i.e., you see your upvote)\\n\\nThe client\xa0*waits*\xa0for the server\'s confirmation\xa0*before*\xa0updating the UI because actions can sometimes fail. Well, at least that was the original idea.\\n\\nThese days, many popular websites update their UIs\xa0*without waiting*\xa0for servers\' responses. Most of the time, everything goes as expected: you click on an upvote, and the server returns a successful response a couple of seconds later (depending on how fast your connection is). Since programmers want their users to have a snappier experience, instead of waiting for a confirmation, they update the UI immediately (as if the action were successful) and then roll back if the server doesn\'t return a successful response (which rarely happens). This pattern of optimistically updating the UI before receiving the confirmation of success is called, you guessed it, an\xa0**Optimistic Update**.\\n\\nMost popular modern websites use optimistic updates to some degree. As mentioned, Reddit uses them for upvotes and downvotes, Youtube uses them for likes, and Trello uses them when moving cards between lists.\\n\\nOptimistic updates are a significant UX improvement, but since they introduce additional state (which can get out of sync with the server), they can be tricky to get right. Then there\'s also the issue of writing additional code for managing the cache and rolling back the changes if the request ends up failing. Luckily, we\'re here to help!\\n\\nWasp recently added native support for optimistic updates, and the rest of this post demonstrates how to quickly set it up in your Wasp application.\\n\\n## A Wasp Todo App Without Optimistic Updates\\n\\nTo honor the tradition of demonstrating UIs using Todo apps, We\'ll show you how to improve the UX of toggling an item\'s status when working with a slow connection.\\nBefore looking at our todo app in action, let\'s see how we\'ve implemented it in Wasp.\\n\\nThese are the relevant declarations in our `.wasp` file:\\n```javascript title=main.wasp\\nentity Task {=psl\\n    id          Int     @id @default(autoincrement())\\n    description String\\n    isDone      Boolean @default(false)\\npsl=}\\n\\n// A query for fetching all tasks.\\nquery getTasks {\\n  fn: import { getTasks } from \\"@server/queries.js\\",\\n  entities: [Task]\\n}\\n\\n\\n// An action for updating the task\'s status.\\naction updateTask {\\n  fn: import { updateTask } from \\"@server/actions.js\\",\\n  entities: [Task]\\n}\\n```\\nThis is the query we use to fetch the tasks (together with their statuses):\\n```javascript title=queries.js\\nexport const getTasks = async (args, context) => {\\n  return context.entities.Task.findMany()\\n}\\n```\\nHere\'s the action we use to update a task\u2019s status:\\n```javascript title=actions.js\\nexport const updateTask = async ({ id, isDone }, context) => {\\n  return context.entities.Task.updateMany({\\n    where: { id },\\n    data: { isDone }\\n  })\\n}\\n```\\nFinally, this is how our client uses this action to update a task:\\n```jsx title=MainPage.js\\nimport updateTask from \'@wasp/queries\'\\n\\n// ...\\n\\nfunction Task({ id, isDone, description }) {\\n  return (\\n    <div className=\\"task\\">\\n      <label className=\\"description\\">\\n        <input\\n          type=\'checkbox\' id={id}\\n          checked={isDone}\\n          onChange={\\n            (e) => updateTask({ id, isDone: e.target.checked })\\n          }\\n        /><span>{description}</span></label>\\n    </div>\\n  )\\n}\\n```\\nLet\'s first see how updating a task looks when everything works as expected (i.e., we\'re on a fast connection):\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"Normal todo list\\"\\n    source=\\"img/optimistic-update-feature-announcement-normal.gif\\"\\n/>\\n\\nSo far, so good! But what happens when our connection is not as fast?\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"Todo list with lag\\"\\n    source=\\"img/optimistic-update-feature-announcement-lag.gif\\"\\n/>\\n\\nHmm, this isn\'t quite as smooth as we\'d like it to be.\\nThe user has to wait for several seconds before seeing their their changes reflected by the UI.\\n\\nHow can we improve it? Well, of course, we can optimistically update the checkbox!\\n\\n## Performing a Wasp Action Optimistically\\nTo perform the `updateTask` action optimistically, all we need to do is decorate the calling code on the client:\\n```jsx {6-16,25} title=MainPage.js \\nimport updateTask from \'@wasp/queries\'\\n\\n// ...\\n\\nfunction Task({ id, isDone, description }) {\\n  const updateTaskOptimistically = useAction(updateTask, {\\n    optimisticUpdates: [{\\n      // Addressing the query we want to update.\\n      getQuerySpecifier: () => [getTasks],\\n      // Telling Wasp how to update the addressed query using the new payload\\n      // and the previously cached data.\\n      updateQuery: ({ id, isDone }, oldTasks) => oldTasks.map(\\n        task => task.id === id ? { ...task, isDone } : task\\n      )\\n    }]\\n  })\\n\\n  return (\\n    <div className=\\"task\\">\\n      <label className=\\"description\\">\\n        <input\\n          type=\'checkbox\' id={id}\\n          checked={isDone}\\n          onChange={\\n            (e) => updateTaskOptimistically({ id, isDone: e.target.checked })\\n          }\\n        /><span>{description}</span></label>\\n    </div>\\n  )\\n}\\n```\\nThose are all the changes we need, the rest of the code (i.e., `main.wasp`, `queries.js` and `actions.js`) remains the same. We won\'t describe the API in detail, but if you\'re curious, everything is covered by [our official docs](/docs/language/features#the-useaction-hook).\\n\\nFinally, let\'s see how this version of the app looks in action:\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"Optimistically updated todo list\\"\\n    source=\\"img/optimistic-update-feature-announcement-fixed.gif\\"\\n/>\\n\\n\\nOur app no longer waits for the server before rendering the changes. Instead, it updates the cache optimistically, continues waiting for the response, and rolls back the changes if the action fails (Wasp internally handles all of this). As previously mentioned, simple changes such as this one rarely fail. Therefore, most of the time, the user enjoys their snappier experience without ever knowing anything special is happening in the background.\\n\\n## What Makes Optimistic Updates Difficult \\nThere\'s an old software engineering joke you\'re probably familiar with:\\n> There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things.\\n\\nOptimistically updating a query involves plenty of meddling with the client-side cache, which is bound to come with a few gotchas. Examples include the answers to questions such as:\\n\\n- What happens when an optimistically updated action fails?\\n- What happens when the user uses the optimistically updated data in a new action?\\n- What happens when the user performs a different action that affects the same cached data as the optimistically updated one?\\n- etc.\\n\\nNotice how Wasp users don\'t need to know about any of these issues when using our optimistic updates API. They only need to tell Wasp which query they wish to update and how, and Wasp takes care of the rest.\\n\\nWasp internally uses\xa0[React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/adapters/react-query), an excellent asynchronous state management library we\'ll gladly recommend to anyone. While React Query does solve some of these problems and helps with some of the rest, we still had to implement quite a complex mechanism to fully cover all edge cases.\\n\\nDescribing this mechanism, although technically interesting, is beyond the scope of a feature announcement. But stay tuned because in a future blog post, we\'ll be taking a deep dive into the infrastructure Wasp uses to ensure optimistic updates are performed correctly and consistently."},{"id":"/2022/11/29/permissions-in-web-apps","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2022/11/29/permissions-in-web-apps","editUrl":"https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/edit/main/web/blog/blog/2022-11-29-permissions-in-web-apps.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-11-29-permissions-in-web-apps.md","title":"Permissions (access control) in web apps","description":"At Wasp, we are working on a config language / DSL for building web apps that integrates with React & Node.js.","date":"2022-11-29T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"November 29, 2022","tags":[{"label":"webdev","permalink":"/blog/tags/webdev"},{"label":"wasp","permalink":"/blog/tags/wasp"}],"readingTime":18.585,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Martin Sosic","title":"Co-founder & CTO @ Wasp","url":"https://github.com/martinsos","imageURL":"https://github.com/martinsos.png","key":"martinsos"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Permissions (access control) in web apps","authors":["martinsos"],"image":"/img/permissions-in-web-apps/auth-spidermen.jpg","tags":["webdev","wasp"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Feature Release Announcement - Wasp Optimistic Updates","permalink":"/blog/2022/11/30/optimistic-update-feature-announcement"},"nextItem":{"title":"Feature Announcement - TypeScript Support","permalink":"/blog/2022/11/29/typescript-feature-announcement"}},"content":"import Link from \'@docusaurus/Link\';\\nimport useBaseUrl from \'@docusaurus/useBaseUrl\';\\n\\nimport InBlogCta from \'./components/InBlogCta\';\\nimport WaspIntro from \'./_wasp-intro.md\';\\nimport ImgWithCaption from \'./components/ImgWithCaption\'\\n\\nAt Wasp, we are working on a config language / DSL for building web apps that integrates with React & Node.js.  \\nThis requires us to deeply understand different parts of what constitutes a web app, in order to be able to model them in our DSL.\\n\\nRecently our focus was on access control, and I decided to capture the learnings in this blog post, to help others quickly get up to speed on how to do access control in web apps.  \\nSo, if you are new to access control in web apps, or have been doing it for some time but want to get a better idea of standard practices, read along!\\n\\n#### Quick overview of what this blog post covers:\\n\\n1.

Permissions, yay! Wait, what are they though?\\n\\nUnless your web app is mostly about static content or is a form of art, it will likely have a notion of users and user accounts.\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"Artistic dolphin painting with brush\\"\\n    source=\\"img/permissions-in-web-apps/dolphin_artist.webp\\"\\n    caption=\\"This dolphin doesn\'t need users\\"\\n/>\\n\\nIn such a case, you will need to know which user has permissions to do what -> who can access which resources, and who can execute which operations.\\n\\nSome common examples of permissions in action:\\n\\n1. User can access only their own user account.\\n2. If the user is an admin, they can ban other users\u2019 accounts.\\n3. User can read other users\u2019 articles, but can\'t modify them.\\n4. The title and description of the article behind the paywall are publicly accessible, but the content is not.\\n5. User can send an email invitation to up to 10 future users per day.\\n\\n### Aha, you mean access control! Sorry, authorization! Hmm, authentication?\\n\\nThere are different terms out there (authentication, authorization, access control, permissions) that are often confused for each other, so let\'s quickly clarify what each one of them stands for.\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"Spidermen representing authN, authZ, AC and permissions pointing at each other\\"\\n    source=\\"img/permissions-in-web-apps/auth-spidermen.jpg\\"\\n    caption=\\"They all look the same!\\"\\n    width=\\"500px\\"\\n/>\\n\\n### 1) Authentication (or as cool kids would say: authN)\\n\\nAct of verifying the user\'s identity.  \\nAnswers the question \\"**Who are they?**\\"\\n\\n> A: Knock Knock  \\n> B: Who is it?  \\n> A: User!  \\n> B: User who?  \\n> A: Authorization: Basic myusername:mypassword\\n>\\n> -> yes, you noticed correctly, this is an example of common authentication method but HTTP header is called \\"Authorization\\"! Weird! But it all makes sense if you squint hard enough: ([https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30062024/why-is-the-http-header-for-authentication-called-authorization](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30062024/why-is-the-http-header-for-authentication-called-authorization)).\\n> \\n\\n### 2) Authorization (or as cool kids would say: authZ)\\n\\nProcess of determining access rights that user has.  \\nAnswers the question \\"**Are they allowed to do this?**\\"\\n\\nNormally you will want the user to be authenticated at this point already, so you have information about them based on which you will decide if they are allowed to do something.\\n\\n### 3) Access Control\\n\\nA higher-level term (compared to authN and authZ) that encompasses the whole process of ensuring that only allowed parties can access specific resources (controlling access to resources -> access control).\\n\\nOften consists of authentication and/or authorization as its steps.\\n\\nAlso often used in the wild interchangeably with just \\"authorization\\".\\nReference (OWASP): [https://www.cgisecurity.com/owasp/html/ch08.html](https://www.cgisecurity.com/owasp/html/ch08.html)\\n\\n### 4) Permission(s)\\n\\nA more general/informal term, closest in meaning to \\"authorization\\" when used in the context of computer science.\\n\\n**Permission** to **access** a **resource** is called **authorization**.\\n\\n### All together\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"Diagram of authN, authZ, AC and permissions relationship\\"\\n    source=\\"img/permissions-in-web-apps/auth-terms-diagram.png\\"\\n    width=\\"350px\\"\\n/>\\n\\nLet\u2019s see these terms used in a sentence by observing the following imagined pull request (PR):\\n\\n> Title: Added **access control** to the app.  \\n>\\n> Description:  \\n> I implemented a way for users to **authenticate** via email and password or via Google.  \\n> On the server-side, I added **permission checks** to most of our REST API handlers, to ensure an **authenticated** user is **authorized** to execute them.  \\n> If the user is not **authorized**, we throw an HTTP error 403.  \\n> There are also some public parts of REST API where the user doesn\u2019t have to be **authenticated**.\\n\\n\\n## 2. Where do we check permissions in a web app: frontend vs backend vs database\\n\\nWe explained a bunch of terms, let\'s see now how access permission checks are actually done in practice!\\n\\nIn a typical web app, you will have a frontend, backend (server), and database.\\n\\nThe frontend will be issuing commands to the server, which then executes operations and possibly modifies the database (on their behalf). Since **users don\u2019t have direct access to the database**, and since the **frontend is inherently not secure**, that leaves the **server as the central place where all the crucial access control needs to happen**.\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"A real-life photo of frontend, server, and database performing access control.\\"\\n    source=\\"img/permissions-in-web-apps/frontend-server-db-access-control.png\\"\\n    caption=\\"A real-life photo of frontend, server, and database performing access control.\\"\\n    width=\\"600px\\"\\n/>\\n\\n### Frontend (browser)\\n\\nBy frontend we mean web client -> code (e.g. JS) that executes in the browser.\\n\\nThe frontend is here to help users issue commands towards the server via which users can access and/or modify the resources of our web app (which are most often stored in the database).\\n\\nSince users can manipulate the frontend code as they wish, we can\'t really do any permissions checks in the frontend code, we can\'t trust it!\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"Imposter of the vent warning that frontend can\'t be trusted\\"\\n    source=\\"img/permissions-in-web-apps/imposter-of-the-vent.png\\"\\n    width=\\"300px\\"\\n/>\\n\\nAny permission checks we do on the frontend, we will need to repeat on the server in any case.  \\nIf that is so, should we at all check permissions on the frontend, and what is the purpose of that?  \\n**The main reason for doing any permissions checks on the frontend is ergonomics/user experience** -> by having UI focus only on resources they can change, we make it easier for users to understand what they can do in our web app and make sure they don\'t waste time on trying to describe complex operations that server will then not be able to execute.\\n\\nSo, for example, our frontend code can hide/omit certain fields in the UI form if the user shouldn\'t be able to access them, it can prevent opening certain pages, or hide/omit certain buttons if they trigger operations that the user is not allowed to perform.\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption alt=\\"Example of using casl.js in React\\"\\n    source=\\"img/permissions-in-web-apps/casl-react-example.png\\"\\n    caption=\\"Example of using casl.js in React to show button only if the user has permission.\\"\\n/>\\n\\n**Takeaway: Permission checks on frontend are not there for security, but only for ergonomics / improving user experience.**\\n\\n### Backend (server)\\n\\nThe server is **a crucial place to implement access control**. It exposes an API that the frontend (browser) and/or other services consume. While doing that, they authenticate with the server, so that server knows who they are, and then they ask (i.e. via REST API or GraphQL API) the server to execute certain operations (i.e. creating, updating, or fetching something). It is the server\u2019s job to figure out if they are allowed (authorized) to perform those operations (on specified resources / with provided arguments) and to reject them if they are not.\\n\\nAt its core, permissions checks on the server are here to **check for each API endpoint** if the caller is allowed to execute it. Often they are executed at the very start of the API endpoint logic, but often they are also intertwined with the rest of the endpoint handler logic.\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption alt=\\"Example of permissions check in backend.\\"\\n    source=\\"img/permissions-in-web-apps/backend-permissions-check-example.png\\"\\n    caption=\\"Example of doing permission check at the start of API endpoint (is user authenticated) and then also doing another check as part of the database query (is user owner of the article they are trying to delete).\\"\\n/>\\n\\nBesides defining checks at API/operation level, they are also often defined at the **data/model level**. This means that they are tied to specific data models (normally from the database), as part of data access logic (ORM), and are defining who can access specific field(s), or even the whole data model.\\n\\n\\nExample of attaching permission checks to the data model directly in the GraphQL schema ([from this blog post](https://www.prisma.io/blog/graphql-directive-permissions-authorization-made-easy-54c076b5368e)):\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"Example of attaching permission checks to the data model directly in the GraphQL schema\\"\\n    source=\\"img/permissions-in-web-apps/data-model-permissions-gql.png\\"\\n/>\\n\\nFor a more sophisticated RBAC approach, with an additional layer of indirection (permissions), read on.\\n\\n\\n### Database\\n\\nUsually, users don\u2019t have direct access to the database at all, instead, they affect it via the server. **In such a case, there is no need to do specific database access control** besides normal constraints that you will have in your DB to ensure data model integrity, like uniqueness, validations, and similar. That said, in some situations, you might want to do it, but we will not get into that in this article.\\n\\n\\n## 3. Common approaches (RBAC, ABAC, \u2026)\\n\\nThe most common approaches to access control are **RBAC** (Role-Based Access Control) and **ABAC** (Attribute-Based Access Control), with RBAC having the strong lead (but ABAC is picking up).\\n\\nAlthough less popular, we will also shortly mention ReBAC as an \u201cin-between\u201d option.\\n\\n### RBAC - Role-based access control\\n\\nRoles rule :D! In [RBAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control), roles are the central concept. Some example roles might be `admin`, `guest`, `writer`, `moderator`, \u2026. When determining if a certain user has access, **we check their roles and determine their access rights based on it**. For example, `admin` can delete other users, articles, and projects, but `guest` can\u2019t modify any resources, only read articles.\\n\\nPro advice (thanks Karan!): While we could be checking the user\u2019s roles directly in the permission checks, it is even better (and recommended by OWASP) to add a layer of indirection \u2192 permissions. **So roles are attached to users, permissions are attached to roles, and permission checks check permissions** (who would expect that :)!?).\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"Users -> Roles -> Permissions\\"\\n    source=\\"img/permissions-in-web-apps/users-roles-permissions.png\\"\\n/>\\n\\nFor example, a user might have role `admin`, and role `admin` has permissions `updateArticle` and `deleteArticle` attached to it. Then, when determining if a user can delete the article, we first fetch his role, then we fetch the permissions attached to that role, and finally check if `deleteArticle` is present among those \u2192 if so, they can continue with the deletion!\\n\\nThis way, if we decide a certain role should have more or fewer permissions, we just add or remove the permission in question to the role, and that is it! We don\u2019t have to go through every permission check and update its logic (which we would have to do if we were checking directly against roles).\\n\\n**RBAC is popular because it is relatively simple and it reflects the basic business domain pretty well** - often we are thinking in the terms of roles in the real world, so it is easy to grasp and understand. There are plenty of solutions and frameworks out there that implement RBAC.\\n\\nWhile a good match for many common use cases, there is a drawback to RBAC - when access control becomes complex (which usually happens as the web app evolves and grows big), RBAC sometimes fails in offering needed granularity in an elegant way, resulting in unwieldy and overly-complex access control logic.\\n\\n### ABAC - Attribute-based access control\\n\\nIn [ABAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribute-based_access_control), key idea is that you define **a bunch of access control rules** where each rule takes different \u201cattributes\u201d as input. When you need to check if a user is authorized to do smth, you run the rules and **if all the rules pass, it is a go**, but if a single rule fails, it is a no go.\\n\\nRule attributes can be anything, but usually, they fall into 4 categories:\\n\\n1. **Subject**: information about a user (i.e. user\u2019s id or name)\\n2. **Action**: operation they want to perform (i.e. reading an Article)\\n3. **Object**: resources they want to operate on (i.e. an Article),\\n4. **Environment/context:** i.e. current time of the day or number of previous requests that the user did in the last hour.\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"ABAC diagram\\"\\n    source=\\"img/permissions-in-web-apps/abac-diagram.png\\"\\n/>\\n\\nLet\u2019s observe the example from before where we wanted to know if user is allowed to delete an article.  \\nIn ABAC, we could define an action \u201cdeleteArticle\u201d, and then define a rule that takes user(subject), action, object, and additional context. That rule would check if action is \u201cdeleteArticle\u201d \u2192 if so, it would evaluate if user is allowed to delete the article specified as an object, by checking some properties of user, maybe even role, or by checking if user is owner of that article.  \\nThen, when user actually issues a command to delete an article, we would ask our access control system to run it against all the rules it has, while giving it the (user, \u201cdeleteArticle\u201d, article, context) tuple \u2192 most of the rules would say all is ok since they are not concerned with \u201cdeleteArticle\u201d action, but the ones that are (like the one we defined above) must all pass in order to actually allow the access.\\n\\n**ABAC is very flexible and general as an approach**, and you could easily implement RBAC (and many other approaches) in ABAC (by checking the user\u2019s role as one of the attributes) \u2192 therefore it is more general/expressive than RBAC.\\n\\nHowever, ABAC is more complex to implement, and it is also more expensive performance-wise, due to needing to check multiple rules each time that access control check is being performed.\\n\\n### ReBAC - Relationship-based access control\\n\\nRoles (RBAC) can be lacking when you need to grant access based on relationship-related questions like \u201cis this user owner of this article\u201d or \u201cdoes this user belong to this workspace\u201d.\\n\\nWhile ABAC can easily handle this, you could also consider it a bit too powerful if all you need to describe are relationships \u2192 and this is where ReBAC comes in.\\n\\nWhile there are different ways one could go about implementing ReBAC, the simplest one is to build on top of RBAC by introducing a concept of \u201crelationship\u201d rules to your access control logic and then checking those alongside the roles. So RBAC with a dash of ABAC (focused on relationships).\\n\\n## 4. OWASP recommendations\\n\\nWhen looking online for \u201cofficial\u201d/standardized recommendations on how to do access control in web apps, you will most likely find resources produced by OWASP.\\n\\nDefinition of OWASP: The Open Web Application Security Project\xae (OWASP) is a nonprofit foundation that works to improve the security of software.\\n\\nI found that they have quite a few resources on how to do access control in web apps, the most interesting being the following:\\n\\n- [OWasp presentation about how to do ACL in Web App](https://owasp.org/www-pdf-archive/ASDC12-Access_Control_Designs_and_Pitfalls.pdf).\\n- [OWasp cheat sheet on how to do ACL in Web App.](https://github.com/OWASP/CheatSheetSeries/blob/master/cheatsheets/Authorization_Cheat_Sheet.md)\\n\\nFrom their materials I extracted a couple of main points that made the most sense to me:\\n\\n- **Centralize the access control logic so it is easy to review.**\\n- **Deny access by default.**\\n- **Prefer ABAC over RBAC.**\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"You should centralize your access control logic - Nyehhh\\"\\n    source=\\"img/permissions-in-web-apps/comic-centralize-logic.png\\"\\n/>\\n\\n## 5. Implementing access control in practice\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"Poll on how do people implement access control\\"\\n    source=\\"img/permissions-in-web-apps/access-control-poll.png\\"\\n    caption=\\"\\"\\n/>\\n\\nHere\u2019s a Reddit [poll I did on r/webdev](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/vhaglx/what_do_you_use_for_access_control_permission/).  \\nAn interesting finding is that even though the sample is pretty small, it is clear that devs prefer RBAC over OWASP-recommended ABAC.  \\nI believe this is due to 2 main reasons: RBAC is simpler + there are more libraries/frameworks out there supporting RBAC than ABAC (again, due to it being simpler).  \\nIt does seem that ABAC is picking up recently though, so it would be interesting to repeat this poll in the future and see what changes.\\n\\n### Organic development\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"Organic growth of my code (meme)\\"\\n    source=\\"img/permissions-in-web-apps/organic-code-meme.png\\"\\n    caption=\\"\\"\\n/>\\n\\nOften, we add permission checks to our web app one by one, as needed. For example, if we are using NodeJS with ExpressJS for our server and writing middleware that handles HTTP API requests, we will add a bit of logic into that middleware that does some checks to ensure a user can actually perform that action. Or maybe we will embed \u201cchecks\u201d into our database queries so that we query only what the user is allowed to access. Often a combination.\\n\\nWhat can be dangerous with such an organic approach is the complexity that arises as the codebase grows - if we don\u2019t put enough effort into centralizing and structuring our access control logic, it can become very hard to reason about it and to do consistent updates to it, leading to mistakes and vulnerabilities.\\n\\nImagine having to modify the web app so that user can now only read their own articles and articles of their friends, while before they were allowed to read any article. If there is only one place where we can make this update, we will have a nice time, but if there are a bunch of places and we need to hunt those down first and then make sure they are all updated in the same way, we are in for a lot of trouble and lot of space to make mistakes.\\n\\n### Using an existing solution\\n\\nInstead of figuring out on our own how to structure the access control code, often it is a better choice to use an existing access control solution! Besides not having to figure and implement everything on your own, another big advantage is that these solutions are battle-tested, which is very important for the code dealing with the security of your web app.\\n\\nWe can roughly divide these solutions into frameworks and (external) providers, where frameworks are embedded into your web app and shipped together with it, while providers are externally hosted and usually paid services.\\n\\nA couple of popular solutions:\\n\\n1. [https://casbin.org/](https://casbin.org/) (multiple approaches, multiple languages, provider)\\n    1. Open source authZ library that has support for many access control models (ACL, RBAC, ABAC, \u2026) and many languages (Go, Java, Node.js, JS, Rust, \u2026). While somewhat complex, it is also powerful and flexible. They also have their Casdoor platform, which is authN and authZ provider.\\n2. [https://casl.js.org/v5/en/](https://casl.js.org/v5/en/) (ABAC, Javascript)\\n    1. Open source JS/TS library for ABAC. CASL gives you a nice way to define the ABAC rules in your web / NodeJS code, and then also check them and call them. It has a bunch of integrations with popular solutions like React, Angular, Prisma, Mongoose, \u2026 .\\n3. https://github.com/CanCanCommunity/cancancan (Ruby on Rails ABAC)\\n    1. Same like casl.js, but for Ruby on Rails! Casl.js was actually inspired and modeled by cancancan.\\n4. https://github.com/varvet/pundit\\n    1. Popular open-source Ruby library focused around the notion of policies, giving you the freedom to implement your own approach based on that.\\n5. [https://spring.io/projects/spring-security](https://spring.io/projects/spring-security) \\n    1. Open source authN and authZ framework for Spring (Java). \\n6. https://github.com/dfunckt/django-rules\\n    1. A generic, approachable open source framework for building rule-based systems in Django (Python).\\n7. [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) (provider)\\n    1. Auth0 has been around for some time and is probably the most popular authN provider out there. While authN is their main offering (they give you SDKs for authentication + they store user profiles and let you manage them through their SaaS), they also allow you to define authZ to some degree, via RBAC and policies.\\n8. [https://www.osohq.com/](https://www.osohq.com/) (provider, DSL)\\n    1. OSO is an authZ provider, unique in a way that they have a specialized language for authorization (DSL, called Polar) in which you define your authorization rules. They come with support for common approaches (e.g. RBAC, ABAC, ReBAC) but also support custom ones. Then, you can use their open source library embedded in your application, or use their managed cloud offering.\\n9. [https://warrant.dev/](https://warrant.dev/) (Provider)\\n    1. Relatively new authZ provider, they have a dashboard where you can manage your rules in a central location and then use them from multiple languages via their SDKs, even on the client to perform UI checks. Rules can also be managed programmatically via SDK.\\n10. [https://authzed.com/](https://authzed.com/) (Provider)\\n    1. AuthZed brings a specialized SpiceDB permissions database which they use as a centralized place for storing and managing rules. Then, you can use their SDKs to query, store, and validate application permissions.\\n\\n## Summary (TLDR)\\n\\n- **Authentication** (authN) answers \u201cwho are they\u201d, **authorization** (authZ) answers \u201care they allowed to\u201d, while **access control** is the overarching term for the whole process of performing authN and authZ.\\n- Doing access control on the frontend is just for show (for improving UX) and you can\u2019t rely on it. **Any and all real access control needs to be done on the server** (possibly a bit in the db, but normally not needed).\\n- While it is ok to start with a simple access control approach at the beginning, you should be ready to switch to a more advanced approach once the complexity grows. The most popular approaches for doing access control are **RBAC** (role-based) and **ABAC** (attribute-based). RBAC is easier to get going with, but ABAC is more powerful.\\n- You should make sure your access control has **as little duplication as possible and is centralized**, in order to reduce the chance of introducing bugs.\\n- It is usually smart to **use existing solutions**, like access control frameworks or external providers.\\n\\n## Access control in Wasp\\n\\nIn [Wasp](https://wasp-lang.dev), we don\u2019t yet have special support for access control, although we are planning to add it in the future. As it seems at the moment, we will probably go for ABAC, and we would love to provide a way to define access rules both at the Operations level and at Entity (data model) level. Due to Wasp\u2019s mission to provide a highly integrated full-stack experience, we are excited about the possibilities this offers to provide an access control solution that is integrated tightly with the whole web app, through the whole stack!\\n\\nYou can check out our discussion about this in our [\u201cSupport for Permissions\u201d RFC](https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/issues/584).\\n\\n## Thanks to the reviewers\\n\\n[Karan Kajla](https://twitter.com/karankajla) (pro advice on RBAC!), [Graham Neray](https://twitter.com/grahamneray) (great general advice + pointed out ReBAC), [Dennis Walsh](https://twitter.com/lawjolla) (awesome suggestions how to have article read better), [Shayne Czyzewski](https://github.com/shayneczyzewski), [Matija Sosic](https://twitter.com/matijasosic), thank you for taking the time to review this article and make it better!

At the time of writing, not all parts of Wasp are typed as well as they could be, but we\'re working on it!\\nExposing all Wasp functionalities through informative typed interfaces is one of our top priorities.\\n\\nWithout further ado, let\'s see how we can use TypeScript with Wasp.\\n\\n## Setting up a TypeScript project in Wasp\\nLet\'s start by creating a fresh Wasp project:\\n\\n```bash\\nwasp new ts-project\\n```\\nThis will generate a project skeleton in the folder `ts-project`. The project structure is different than before, and there are now several additional generated files that help with IDE and TypeScript support. So let\'s explain it:\\n```\\n.\\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 .gitignore\\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 main.wasp             # Your wasp code goes here.\\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 src\\n\u2502\xa0\xa0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 client            # Your client code (JS/CSS/HTML) goes here.\\n\u2502\xa0\xa0 \u2502\xa0\xa0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 Main.css\\n\u2502\xa0\xa0 \u2502\xa0\xa0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 MainPage.jsx\\n\u2502\xa0\xa0 \u2502\xa0\xa0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 react-app-env.d.ts\\n\u2502\xa0\xa0 \u2502\xa0\xa0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 tsconfig.json\\n\u2502\xa0\xa0 \u2502\xa0\xa0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 waspLogo.png\\n\u2502\xa0\xa0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 server            # Your server code (Node JS) goes here.\\n\u2502\xa0\xa0 \u2502\xa0\xa0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 tsconfig.json\\n\u2502\xa0\xa0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 shared            # Your shared (runtime independent) code goes here.\\n\u2502\xa0\xa0 \u2502\xa0\xa0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 tsconfig.json\\n\u2502\xa0\xa0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 .waspignore\\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 .wasproot\\n```\\n\\n\\nAt this point, we can chose one of three options:\\n1. We write our code exclusively in JavaScript.\\n2. We write our code exclusively in TypeScript.\\n3. We write some parts of our code in JavaScript, and other parts in TypeScript.\\n\\nSince the third option is a superset of the first two, that\'s what Wasp currently supports. In other words, regardless of whether you want your entire codebase in one of these languages or you want to mix it up, there\'s no extra configuration necessary!\\nSimply use the appropriate extension (`.ts` and `.tsx` for TypeScript; `.js` and `.jsx` for JavaScript), and your IDE and Wasp will know what to do.\\n\\nTo demonstrate this, let\'s start Wasp and change `MainPage.jsx` to `MainPage.tsx`:\\n```\\nwasp start\\nmv src/client/MainPage.jsx src/client/MainPage.tsx\\n```\\nThat\'s it! Wasp will notice the change and recompile, and your app will continue to work. The only difference is that you can now write TypeScript in `MainPage.tsx` and get helpful information from your IDE and the static type checker. Try removing an import and see what happens.\\n\\nThe same applies to any file you may want to include in your project. Specify the language you wish to use via the extension, and Wasp will do the rest!\\n\\n:::caution\\nEven if you use TypeScript and have a _server_ file called `someFile.ts`, you must still import it as if it had the `.js` extension (i.e., `import foo from \'someFile.js\'`). Wasp internally uses `esnext` module resolution, which always requires specifying the extension as `.js` (i.e., the extension used in the emitted JS file). This applies to all `@server` imports (and files on the server in general).\\n\\nRead more about ES modules in TypeScript [here](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/esm-node.html). If you\'re interested in the discussion and the reasoning behind this, read about it [in this GitHub issue](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/33588).\\n\\nThis does not apply to front-end files. Thanks to Webpack, you don\'t need to write extensions when working with client-side imports.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n## Moving existing projects to the new structure (and optionally TypeScript)\\nIf you wish to move an existing project to the new structure, the easiest approach comes down to creating a new project and moving all the files from your old project into appropriate locations. After doing this, you can choose which files you\'d like to implement in TypeScript, change the extension and go for it.\\n\\n\\nTo avoid digging too deep, this is all we\'ll say about migrating. For a more detailed migration guide, check [our changelog](https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/releases/tag/v0.7.0). It explains everything step-by-step.\\n\\n## TypeScript in action\\nFinally, let\'s demonstrate how TypeScript helps us by using it in a small Todo app. The part of our code in charge of rendering tasks looks something like this:\\n```jsx\\n\\nfunction MainPage() {\\n  const { data: tasks } = useQuery(getTasks)\\n\\n  return (\\n    <div>\\n      <h1>Todos</h1>\\n      <TaskList tasks={tasks} />\\n    </div>\\n  )\\n}\\n\\nfunction TaskList({ tasks }) {\\n  if (!tasks.len) {\\n    return <div>No tasks</div>\\n  }\\n\\n  return (\\n    <div>\\n      {tasks.map((task, idx) => <Task {...task} key={idx}/>)}\\n    </div>\\n  )\\n}\\n\\n\\n\\nfunction Task({ id, isdone, description }) {\\n  return (\\n    <div>\\n      <label>\\n        <input\\n          type=\'checkbox\'\\n          id={id}\\n          checked={isdone}\\n          onChange={\\n            (event) => updateTask({ id, isDone: event.target.checked })\\n          }\\n        />\\n        <span>{description}</span>\\n      </label>\\n    </div>\\n  )\\n}\\n```\\nTry to see if you can find any bugs. When you\'re confident you\'ve got all of them, continue reading.\\n\\nLet\'s see what happens when we bring TypeScript into the picture. Remember, we only need to change the extension to `tsx`. After we do this, The IDE will warn us about missing type definitions, so let\'s fill these in. While we\'re at it, we can also tell `useQuery` what types it\'s working with by specifying its type arguments.\\n\\nHere\'s how our code looks after these changes:\\n```tsx\\n// highlight-start\\ntype Task = {\\n  id: string\\n  description: string\\n  isDone: boolean\\n}\\n// highlight-end\\n\\nfunction MainPage() {\\n  // highlight-next-line\\n  const { data: tasks } = useQuery<Task, Task[]>(getTasks)\\n\\n  return (\\n    <div>\\n      <h1>Todos</h1>\\n      <TaskList tasks={tasks} />\\n    </div>\\n  )\\n}\\n\\n// highlight-next-line\\nfunction TaskList({ tasks }: { tasks: Task[] }) {\\n  if (!tasks.len) {\\n    return <div>No tasks</div>\\n  }\\n\\n  return (\\n    <div>\\n      {tasks.map((task, idx) => <Task {...task} key={idx}/>)}\\n    </div>\\n  )\\n}\\n\\n\\n\\n// highlight-next-line\\nfunction Task({ id, isdone, description }: Task) {\\n  return (\\n    <div>\\n      <label>\\n        <input\\n          type=\'checkbox\'\\n          id={id}\\n          checked={isdone}\\n          onChange={\\n            (event) => updateTask({ id, isDone: event.target.checked })\\n          }\\n        />\\n        <span>{description}</span>\\n      </label>\\n    </div>\\n  )\\n}\\n```\\nAs soon as we change our code, TypeScript detects three errors:\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"TypeScript erros\\"\\n    source=\\"img/typescript-errors.png\\"\\n    caption=\\"The errors are pretty simple (almost as if we\'ve made them up for this example :)\\"\\n/>\\n\\n1. The first error warns us that `tasks` might be `undefined` (e.g., on the first render), which `TaskList` does not expect\\n2. The second error tells us that the property `len` does not exist on the array `tasks`. In other words, we misspelled `length`.\\n3. Finally, the third error tells us that the type `Task` does not contain the field `isdone`. This is also a typo. The field\'s name should be `isDone`.\\n\\nThanks to TypeScript, we can quickly fix all three errors, saving us a lot of time we\'d probably lose by hunting them down manually or, even worse, during runtime.\\n```tsx\\n\\ntype Task = {\\n  id: string\\n  description: string\\n  isDone: boolean\\n}\\nfunction MainPage() {\\n  const { data: tasks } = useQuery<Task, Task[]>(getTasks)\\n\\n  return (\\n    <div>\\n      <h1>Todos</h1>\\n      // highlight-next-line\\n      {tasks && <TaskList tasks={tasks} />}\\n    </div>\\n  )\\n}\\n\\nfunction TaskList({ tasks }: { tasks: Task[] }) {\\n  // highlight-next-line\\n  if (!tasks.length) {\\n    return <div>No tasks</div>\\n  }\\n\\n  return (\\n    <div>\\n      {tasks.map((task, idx) => <Task {...task} key={idx} />)}\\n    </div>\\n  )\\n}\\n\\n\\n\\n// highlight-next-line\\nfunction Task({ id, isDone, description }: Task) {\\n  return (\\n    <div>\\n      <label>\\n        <input\\n          type=\'checkbox\'\\n          id={id}\\n          // highlight-next-line\\n          checked={isDone}\\n          onChange={\\n            (event) => updateTask({ id, isDone: event.target.checked })\\n          }\\n        />\\n        <span>{description}</span>\\n      </label>\\n    </div>\\n  )\\n}\\n```\\n\\nAnd that\'s it! This is the joy of TypeScript. We\'ve easily fixed all reported errors, and our code should now work correctly (well, at least less incorrectly).\\n\\n## Future work\\nYou might have noticed that, if we want to use the `Task` type, we have to write most of its type definition twice - once when defining the `Task` entity in the `.wasp` file and then again in our code. While we can define the type in `src/shared` to avoid writing (almost) the same code on both the server and the client, we\'ll still have duplication between the code in `src/shared` and our `.wasp` file.\\n\\nThe good news is that we know about this, also find it annoying, and are working to fix it as soon as possible! In the near future, Wasp will generate types from entities and allow you to access them using `@wasp` imports. Other improvements exist, too. For example, Wasp could read your query declarations and provide you with the correct type for the `context` object in their definitions. Another possible improvement is automatically typing queries on the front-end, and then relying on type inference to correctly type `useQuery` (instead of users specifying its type arguments explicitly).\\n\\nIn short, there\'s a long and exciting path ahead of us, full of interesting possibilities. So stick with Wasp and see how far we can make it!"},{"id":"/2022/11/29/wasp-beta","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2022/11/29/wasp-beta","editUrl":"https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/edit/main/web/blog/blog/2022-11-29-wasp-beta.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-11-29-wasp-beta.md","title":"Wasp is in Beta: Auth, TypeScript, Tailwind, LSP","description":"Wasp is a simple configuration language for building full-stack web apps with less code and ensured best practices.

When choosing the solution to build our database layer on top, we chose Prisma, even though it was still somehwat new tech at that point, and we believe today we made a great choice -> read on to learn why!\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nAt Wasp, [we aim](/docs/vision) to simplify full-stack web development via a specialized high-level language. This language allows you to describe the main parts of your web app succinctly, avoiding a lot of usual boilerplate and configuration while giving you lots of features and ensuring best practices. Wasp is essentially a full-stack web framework implemented as a specialized language that works with React & Node.js!\\n\\nWhen we started working on Wasp, we wanted to keep it easy to learn and to the point, so we decided:\\n\\n- the Wasp language should only be used at a high level, so you would still use React, NodeJS, HTML, CSS, etc. to implement your custom logic. If a full-stack web app is an orchestra, Wasp is the conductor.\\n- the Wasp language should be declarative and simple, very similar to JSON, but \u201csmarter\u201d in the sense it understands web app concepts and makes sure your app follows them.\\n\\nWith that in mind, we focused on identifying high-level web app concepts that are worth capturing in the Wasp language. We identified the following parts of a web app:\\n\\n- General app info (title, head, favicon, \u2026)\\n- Pages and Routes\\n- Data Models (aka Entities), e.g. User, Task, Organization, Article, \u2026 .\\n- Operations (communication between client and server; CRUD on data models, 3rd party APIs, \u2026)\\n- Deployment\\n\\n## Entities\\n\\nOf all of those, Entities are in the middle of everything, present through the whole codebase, and are central to all the other parts of the web app: client, server, and database. They were, however, also the most daunting part to implement!\\n\\nWhen we started, we imagined an Entity would look something like this in Wasp:\\n\\n```\\nentity User {\\n  id: Id,\\n  username: String @unique,\\n  email: String @unique\\n  groups: [Group]\\n}\\n```\\n\\nWhile adding this initial syntax to our language was feasible, there were also much bigger tasks to tackle in order to make this a proper solution:\\n\\n- expand syntax to be flexible enough for real-life use cases\\n- support migrations (data and schema)\\n- generate code that users can call from JS/TS to query and update entities in the DB\\n- and probably a lot of other things that we hadn\u2019t even thought of yet!\\n\\n## Mongoose, Sequelize, \u2026 or Prisma?\\n\\nWe already decided that we would pick an ORM(ish) solution for JS/TS which we would build the rest of the features on top of. We started evaluating different ones: Mongoose, Sequelize, TypeORM, \u2026 .\\n\\nBut then we looked at Prisma, and the winner was clear! Not only was Prisma taking care of everything that we cared about, but it had one additional feature that made it a perfect fit:\\n\\n```\\nmodel User {\\n  id          Int     @id @default(autoincrement())\\n  username    String  @unique\\n  password    String\\n}\\n```\\n\\nNo, this is not another idea of how the syntax for Entities could look like in Wasp language \u2192 this is the Prisma Schema Language (PSL)!!!\\n\\n## Prisma Schema Language (PSL)\\n\\nIndeed, Prisma is unique in having a special, declarative language for describing data models (schema), and it was exactly what we needed for Wasp.\\n\\nSo instead of implementing our own syntax for describing Entities, we decided to use Prisma and their PSL to describe Entities (data models) inside the Wasp language.\\n\\nToday, Entities are described like this in Wasp language:\\n\\n```\\n... some Wasp code ...\\n\\nentity User {=psl\\n  id          Int     @id @default(autoincrement())\\n  username    String  @unique\\n  password    String\\npsl=} \\n\\n... some Wasp code ...\\n```\\n\\nSo in the middle of Wasp, you just switch to writing PSL (Prisma Schema Language) to describe an entity!\\n\\nAnother great thing is that the PSL is at its core a pretty simple language, so we [implemented our own parser](https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/blob/main/waspc/src/Wasp/Psl/Parser/Model.hs) for it \u2192 that means that Wasp actually understands what you wrote, even though it is PSL, and can fully work with it. So we lost nothing by using PSL instead of our own syntax and instead gained all the features that Prisma brings.\\n\\n## Other Benefits\\n\\nBesides PSL, there were plenty of other reasons why we felt Prisma is a great fit for us:\\n\\n -  It is targeting Javascript / Typescript.\\n -  It takes care of migrations and has a nice workflow for doing it.\\n -  It supports different databases: Mongo, PostgreSQL, CockroachDB, \u2026, which is very important for Wasp since our vision is to support different stacks in the future.\\n -  It has Prisma Studio - UI for inspecting your database, which we also make available to you via Wasp CLI.\\n -  It keeps improving quickly and is very focused on a nice developer experience, which is also our focus here at Wasp.\\n -  Community is extremely welcoming and the core team is super helpful - all of our questions and issues were answered super quickly!\\n\\n## Challenges\\n\\nWhile integrating Prisma into Wasp went really smoothly, there were a few hiccups:\\n\\n -  Getting Prisma CLI to provide interactive output while being called programmatically by Wasp was tricky, and in the end, we had to use a bit of a dirty approach to trick the Prisma CLI into thinking it is called interactively. We opened an issue for this with Prisma, so hopefully, we will be able to remove this once it is resolved: https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/7113.\\n -  In the early days, there were some bugs, however, they were always quickly solved, so updating to the newest Prisma version was often the solution.\\n -  It took us a bit of fiddling to get Prisma to work with its schema outside of the server\u2019s root directory, but we did get it working in the end!\\n\\nMost of these were due to us stretching the boundaries of how Prisma was imagined to be used, but in total Prisma proved to be fairly flexible!\\n\\n## Summary\\n\\nWith its declarative language for describing schema, focus on ergonomics, and JS/TS as the target language, Prisma was really a stroke of luck for us - if not for it, it would have taken much more effort to get the Entities working in Wasp.\\n\\nWhen we started using it, Prisma was still somewhat early, and it was certainly the least-mature technology in our stack - but we decided to bet on it because it was just a perfect fit, and it made so much sense. Today, with Prisma being a mature and popular solution, we are more than happy we made that choice!\\n\\n## Future\\n\\nAlready, Prisma is playing a big role at Wasp, but there is still more that we plan and want to do:\\n\\n - support Prisma\u2019s Enum and Type declarations\\n - expose more of Prisma\u2019s CLI commands, especially database seeding\\n - add support in Wasp for multiple databases (which Prisma already supports)\\n - improve IDE support for PSL within the Wasp language\\n\\nIf you are interested in helping with any of these, reach out to us on this issue https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/issues/641, or in any case, join us on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/rzdnErX)!"},{"id":"/2022/11/26/erlis-amicus-usecase","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2022/11/26/erlis-amicus-usecase","editUrl":"https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/edit/main/web/blog/blog/2022-11-26-erlis-amicus-usecase.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-11-26-erlis-amicus-usecase.md","title":"Amicus: See how Erlis built a SaaS for legal teams with Wasp and got first paying customers!","description":"amicus hero shot","date":"2022-11-26T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"November 26, 2022","tags":[{"label":"webdev","permalink":"/blog/tags/webdev"},{"label":"wasp","permalink":"/blog/tags/wasp"},{"label":"startups","permalink":"/blog/tags/startups"},{"label":"github","permalink":"/blog/tags/github"}],"readingTime":4.21,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Matija Sosic","title":"Co-founder & CEO @ Wasp","url":"https://github.com/matijasos","imageURL":"https://github.com/matijasos.png","key":"matijasos"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Amicus: See how Erlis built a SaaS for legal teams with Wasp and got first paying customers!","authors":["matijasos"],"image":"/img/amicus-usecase/amicus-hero-shot.png","tags":["webdev","wasp","startups","github"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Why we chose Prisma as a database layer for Wasp","permalink":"/blog/2022/11/28/why-we-chose-prisma"},"nextItem":{"title":"How Michael Curry chose Wasp to build Grabbit: an internal tool for managing dev resources at StudentBeans","permalink":"/blog/2022/11/26/michael-curry-usecase"}},"content":"import Link from \'@docusaurus/Link\';\\nimport useBaseUrl from \'@docusaurus/useBaseUrl\';\\n\\nimport InBlogCta from \'./components/InBlogCta\';\\nimport WaspIntro from \'./_wasp-intro.md\';\\nimport ImgWithCaption from \'./components/ImgWithCaption\'\\n\\n\\n![amicus hero shot](../static/img/amicus-usecase/amicus-hero-shot.png)\\n\\n\\n[Erlis Kllogjri](https://github.com/ErlisK) is an engineer based in San Francisco with broad experience ranging from mechanical engineering and C/C++ microcontroller programming to Python and web app development. In his free time, Erlis enjoys working on side projects, which is also how [Amicus](https://www.amicus.work/) started out.\\n\\n[Amicus](https://www.amicus.work/) is a SaaS for legal teams - think about it as \\"Asana for lawyers\\", but with features and workflows tailored to the domain of law.\\n\\nRead on to learn how long it took Erlis to develop the first version of his SaaS with Wasp, how he got his first paying customers, and what features he plans to add next!\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Looking for a full-stack \u201call-in-one\u201d solution, with React & Node.js\\n\\nErlis first learned about Wasp on HackerNews and it immediately caught his attention, particularly the configuration language part. One of the companies he worked at in the past had its own internal DSL in the hardware domain, and he understood how helpful it could be for moving fast and avoiding boilerplate.\\n\\nErlis also had previous experience in web development, especially on the front-end side in React and Javascript, so that made Wasp a logical choice.\\n\\n> I was looking at other solutions, but none of them were full-stack and sounded like a lot of work just to stitch everything together and get started. I just wanted to get the job done and didn\u2019t care about picking the stack specifics myself. Wasp was really helpful as it set me up with the best practices and I had everything running in just a few minutes!\\n>\\n> \u2014 Erlis Kllogjri - Amicus\\n\\n## Building Amicus v1.0 and getting first customers!\\n\\nThe idea for Amicus came from his brother, who is employed at a law firm - talking about their process and challenges in executing them, Erlis thought it would be an interesting side project, especially given there is a real problem to solve.\\n\\nSoon, the first version of Amicus was live! It was made in a true lean startup fashion, starting with the essential features and immediately being tested with users.\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"Amicus\'s dashboard\\"\\n    source=\\"img/amicus-usecase/amicus-dashboard.png\\"\\n    caption=\\"Amicus\'s dashboard, using Material-UI\\"\\n/>\\n\\nErlis used Material-UI as a UI library since it came with one of the example apps built in Wasp (Beta introduced Tailwind support!). Users could track their clients, active legal matters and there was even integrated billing with Stripe! Amicus also extensively used Wasp\u2019s [Async Jobs](https://wasp-lang.dev/blog/2022/06/15/jobs-feature-announcement) feature to regularly update invoices, send reminder emails and clear out old data from the database.\\n\\nAfter a few iterations with the legal team who were Amicus\' test user (e.g. adding support for different types of users via roles), they were ready to get onboarded and become paying customers! More than 20 people from a single company are using Amicus daily for their work, making it an amazing source of continuous feedback for further development.\\n\\nErlis enjoyed the most how fast he could progress and ship features with Wasp on a weekly basis. Having both front-end, back-end, and database set and fully configured to work together from the beginning, he could focus on developing features rather than spend time figuring out the intricacies of the specific stack.\\n\\n> If it weren\'t for Wasp, Amicus would probably have never been finished. I estimate it saved me 100+ hours from the start and I\'m still amazed that I did all this work as a team-of-one.

In his free time he enjoys learning about compilers.\\n\\nIn his previous position at StudentBeans, he experienced the problem of multiple engineering teams competing for the same dev environment (e.g. testing, staging, \u2026). Then he discovered Wasp and decided to do something about it!\\n\\nRead on to learn why Michael chose Wasp to build and deploy an internal tool for managing development environments at StudentBeans.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## The problem: the battle for the dev environment\\n\\nStudentBeans has a microservices-based architecture with multiple environments - test, staging, production, \u2026. The team practices CI/CD and deploys multiple times a day. With such a rapid development speed, it would relatively often happen that multiple engineering teams attempt to claim the same dev environment at the same time. \\n\\nThere wasn\'t an easy way for teams to synchronize on who is using which environment and it would eventually lead to unexpected changes, confusion, and prolonged development times.\\n\\n## The solution: Grabbit - claim and release dev environments as-you-go\\n\\nAfter the incident described above repeated for the n-th time, the team got together for a postmortem. They decided their new development process should look like this:\\n\\n- merge your changes\\n- claim the environment you want to deploy to (e.g. testing, staging, \u2026)\\n- deploy your changes\\n- test your changes\\n- release the environment once you are done with it so others are able to claim it\\n\\nThe other requirements were to build the solution in-house to save money and also not to spend more than a few hours on it as they still needed to deliver some important features for the ongoing sprint.\\n\\n## The power of rapid prototyping with Wasp\\n\\nMichael learned about Wasp during its [first HackerNews launch](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26091956) and it immediately caught his eye. Being a programming language enthusiast himself, he immediately understood the value of a DSL approach and how it could drastically simplify the development process, while at the same time not preventing him from using his preferred tech stack (React, Node.js) when needed.\\n\\nAlso, although Michael had full-stack experience, his primary strength at the time was on the front-end side. Wasp looked like a great way of not having to deal with the tedious back-end setup and wiring (setting up the database, figuring out API, \u2026) and being able to focus on the UX.\\n\\n> When I first learned about Wasp on HN I was really excited about its DSL approach. It was amazing how fast I could get things running with Wasp - I had the first version within an hour! The language is also fairly simple and straightforward and plays well with React & Node.js + it removes a ton of boilerplate.\\n>\\n> \u2014 Michael Curry - Grabbit\\n\\n## Out-of-the-box deployment\\n\\nOnce Michael was satisfied with the first version of Grabbit, and confirmed with the team it fits their desired process, the only thing left to do was to deploy it! It is well known this step can get really complicated, especially if you\'re not yet well-versed in the sea of config options that usually come with it.\\n\\nWasp CLI comes with a `wasp build` command that does all the heavy lifting for you - it creates a directory with static front-end files that you can easily deploy to e.g. Netlify, and on the other hand, a Docker image for the back-end. Since Heroku is ending its free plan, our recommendation is to deploy to Fly.io, for which the detailed guide is provided. You can find the [detailed deployment instructions here](https://wasp-lang.dev/docs/deploying).\\n\\nIn Michael\'s case, he deployed Grabbit behind the VPN since it was an internal tool, and this process was made easy by having a ready-to-go Dockerfile.\\n\\n## From MVP to a full-fledged SaaS without a rewrite\\n\\nThe presented functionality of Grabbit above is quite simple (create a resource \u2192 claim it \u2192 release it), and it could have easily been implemented in some no-code tool or, if we really wanted to go simple, with a Trello board. So why use Wasp at all?\\n\\nOne reason is that developers know and prefer their tools and trust code over the no-code solutions, especially when requirements are still evolving and it is not evident they won\'t get \\"stuck\\" in some closed system. Michael had similar thinking - as he identified this problem at his own company, he realized others must be facing the same issue as well. That is why his plan was to keep improving Grabbit and eventually offer it as a standalone SaaS.\\n\\nThis is where Wasp comes in - he could develop and deploy an initial version of Grabbit in a matter of hours, but still end up with a platform that he can extend indefinitely through the power of code with his stack of choice, React & Node.js, while also using the npm packages he is using everyday at work.\\n\\nOnce he starts adding more advanced features, such as multi-user support with authentication, email notifications, and integration with CI/CD, no-code tools won\'t cut it any more. This way he saved himself and the company from throwing an MVP away and starting everything from scratch (having to learn the new technology and figure out how to set it all up) as the product evolves."},{"id":"/2022/11/26/wasp-beta-launch-week","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2022/11/26/wasp-beta-launch-week","editUrl":"https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/edit/main/web/blog/blog/2022-11-26-wasp-beta-launch-week.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-11-26-wasp-beta-launch-week.md","title":"Wasp Beta Launch Week announcement","description":"It\u2019s almost here!

It\u2019s easier and cooler than ever, supports 3rd party providers (hint: starts with \u201cG\u201d), and works smoother than a jar of peanut butter (not the crunchy one of course)!\\n\\n## Monday, Nov 28 - TypeScript support!\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"TypeScript is here!\\"\\n    source=\\"img/beta-ann/thank-you-god.gif\\"\\n/>\\n\\nWhen we asked you what was missing in Wasp during our [Alpha Testing Program](/blog/2022/11/16/alpha-testing-program-post-mortem), you were pretty clear:\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"TypeScript is wanted!\\"\\n    source=\\"img/beta-ann/ts-wanted.png\\"\\n/>\\n\\nWe heard you (honestly we were missing it too) and now it\u2019s here! You can write your code in TypeScript and enjoy all the goodies that types bring. Some things already work really well and there are a few for which we still have ideas on how to make them better, but more on that on Tuesday!\\n\\n## Wednesday, Nov 29 - Tailwind support! \ud83d\udc08\xa0\ud83d\udca8\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"Tailwind Nic Cage\\"\\n    source=\\"img/beta-ann/nic-cage-tailwind.gif\\"\\n/>\\n\\nIt\u2019s beautiful! Another highly anticipated featured that also comes with Beta - support for Tailwind CSS framework! Since it has an additional build step it didn\u2019t work out-of-the-box with Alpha, but now it works like a breeze (see what I did here?)!\\n\\nHonestly, having used it for designing our new Beta landing page I can really see why it gained so much popularity. So long, making up names for classes, \u201ccontainers\u201d, and \u201cwrappers\u201d!\\n\\n## Thursday, Nov 30 - Optimistic updates!\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"Without optimistic updates\\"\\n    source=\\"img/beta-ann/no-opt-updates.gif\\"\\n    caption=\\"Stop glitching, dang it!\\"\\n/>\\n\\nYou know that feeling when you move your Trello card \u201cTry Wasp Beta\u201d from \u201cTodo\u201d column to \u201cDone\u201d column and everything works super smoothly without any glitches? That\u2019s because of optimistic updates! You may not need it often but if you needed and it wasn\u2019t possible you\u2019d feel really sad.\\n\\nWell, that\u2019s why Alpha is called Alpha and Beta is called Beta \ud83d\ude05. Long story short, now it\u2019s possible to do it in Wasp and it\u2019s also super easy and clean! We\'re actually very optimistic you\u2019ll feel really good about implementing optimistic updates for your app in Wasp.\\n\\n## Friday, Dec 1 - Improved IDE support, tooling and Wasp LSP!\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"VS Code support for Wasp LSP\\"\\n    source=\\"img/beta-ann/wasp-loves-vscode.png\\"\\n/>\\n\\nIf you like types in TypeScript (and in general), then you will also enjoy Wasp! Our DSL is also a typed language which means it can report errors in compile time, e.g. in case you haven\u2019t configured your route correctly. And now all that happens directly in your editor!\\n\\n**Beta brings LSP, Language Server for Wasp that works with VS Code** (support for other editors coming soon! I\u2019m VIM user myself so take a guess :D). That means improved syntax highlighting, code autocompletion and live error reporting - everything you\u2019d expect from a language!\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"Wasp Language Server in action\\"\\n    source=\\"img/beta-ann/wls-demo.gif\\"\\n    caption=\\"Wasp LSP in action!\\"\\n/>\\n\\n## Saturday, Dec 2 - Grande Finale + #1 Wasp Hackathon!(Waspathon\ud83d\udc1d\xa0?)\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"First Wasp hackathon\\"\\n    source=\\"img/beta-ann/hackathon-banner.gif\\"\\n/>\\n\\nI don\u2019t want to reveal too much in advance, but yep there will be a hackathon, yep there will be cool rewards (at least we think so) and yep it will be awesome!

October has been a blast, to say the least, and the most active month in the repo\'s history.\\n\\nThis is the story of our journey along with the tips on leveraging Hacktoberfest to get your repo buzzing! \ud83d\udc1d\ud83d\udc1d\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## How it went: the stats\\n\\nLet\'s take a quick look at the charts below (data obtained from [OSS Insight](https://ossinsight.io/analyze/wasp-lang/wasp) platform) \ud83d\udc47\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"PR history\\"\\n    source=\\"img/hacktoberfest-wrap-up/pr-history.png\\"\\n    caption=\\"24 contributor PRs in Oct, an all-time high!\\"\\n/>\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"Lines of code changes\\"\\n    source=\\"img/hacktoberfest-wrap-up/code-lines-history.png\\"\\n    caption=\\"On the other hand, number of changed LoC isn\'t that huge\\"\\n/>\\n\\nWhile the number of PRs is at an all-time high, the number of updated lines of code is fewer than usual. If we take a look at the distribution of PR sizes in the first chart, we can see that \\"xs\\" and \\"s\\" PRs are in the majority (20 out of 24).\\n\\n**This brings us to our first conclusion: first-time contributors start with small steps!** The main benefit here is getting potential contributors interested and familiar with the project, rather than expecting them to jump in and\\nimmediately start implementing the next major feature. Efforts like that require investing time to understand and digest codebase architecture, design decisions and the development process.\\n\\nOn the other hand, being able to implement and merge any feature, no matter the size, from beginning to the end, and to get your name on the list of contributors of your favourite project is an amazing feeling! That will make your contributors feel like superheroes and motivate them to keep taking on larger and larger chunks, and maybe eventually even join the core team!\\n\\n**Thus, the second conclusion would be: don\u2019t underestimate the significance of small PRs!** It\'s not about reducing your backlog, but rather encouraging developers to get engaged with your project in a friendly way.\\n\\n:::tip\\n\\nTo make it easier for your new contributors, you can prepare in advance good issues to get started with - e.g. smaller bugs, docs improvements, fun but isolated problems, etc.\\n\\nWe added [`good-first-issue`](https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) label to such issues in Wasp repo, and even added extra context such as `no-haskell`, `webdev`, `example`, `docs`.\\n\\n:::\\n\\nWith your repo being set, the next question is *\\"How do I get people to pick my project to work on\\"*? Relying solely\\non putting \\"Hacktoberfest\\" topic on your GitHub repo won\'t do the trick, not with thousands of other repos doing the same.\\n\\nIf you want to get noticed, **you need to do marketing. A lot of it. The name of the game here is what you put in is what you get back.** Let\'s talk about this in more detail.\\n\\n## A thin line between genuine interactions and annoying self-promotion\\n\\nFirst and foremost, you\'ll need to create [an entry point](https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/issues/735) with all the necessary information for the participants. We opted for a GitHub issue where we categorized Hacktoberfest issues by type, complexity, etc, but it can be anything - a dedicated landing page, Medium/Dev.to article, or whatever works for you. Once you have that, you can start promoting it.\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"Hacktoberfest entry point - gh issue\\"\\n    source=\\"img/hacktoberfest-wrap-up/hf-gh-entry-point.png\\"\\n    caption=\\"Our entry point for Hacktoberfest\\"\\n/>\\n\\nOur marketing strategy consisted of the following:\\n\\n1. Tweeting regularly - what\'s new, interesting issues, ...\\n\\n2. Writing meaningful Reddit posts about your achievements\\n\\n3. Hanging out in HacktoberFest [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/hacktoberfest), chatting with others and answering their questions\\n\\n4. Checking posts with [appropriate](https://dev.to/t/hacktoberfest) [tags](https://medium.com/tag/hacktoberfest2022) on different blogging websites like Medium, Dev.to, Hashnode, etc. and participating in conversations. \\n\\nThere are plenty of other ways to advertise your project, like joining events or writing articles. Even [meme contests](https://github.com/dailydotdev/memetoberfest). The activities mentioned above worked the best for us. Let\u2019s dive a bit deeper.\\n\\nTweets are pretty obvious - as mentioned, you can share updates on how stuff is going. Tag contributors, inform your followers about available issues and mention those who might be a good fit for tackling them.  \\n\\nReddit is a much more complex beast. You need to avoid clickbait post titles, comply with subreddit rules on self-promotion and try to give meaningful info to the community simultaneously. Take less than you give, and you\u2019re good. \\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"posting on reddit\\"\\n    source=\\"img/hacktoberfest-wrap-up/oss-reddit-post.png\\"\\n    caption=\\"How posting on Reddit feels\\"\\n/>\\n\\n\\nThe Discord server marketing was pretty straightforward. There\u2019s even a dedicated channel for self-promotion. In case you\'re not talkative much, dropping a link to your project is OK, and that\u2019s it. On the other hand, the server is an excellent platform for discussing Hacktoberfest-related issues, approaches, and ideas. The more you chat, the higher your chances of drawing attention to your project.\\n\\nThe most engaging but also time consuming activity was commenting on blog posts of other Hacktoberfest participants. **Pretending that you\u2019re interested in the topic only to leave a self-promoting comment will not bring you anywhere - it can only result in your comment being removed**. Make sure to provide value: add more information on the topic of the article, address specific points the author may have missed, or mention how you\u2019ve dealt with the related issue in your project. \\n\\nBe consistent and dedicate time to regularly to check new articles and jump into discussions. Share a link to your repo only if it fits into the flow of the conversation.\\n\\n![Content marketing in a nutshell](../static/img/hacktoberfest-wrap-up/content-marketing-in-a-nutshell.png)\\n\\n## Was it worth it?\\n\\nBefore joining HacktoberFest as maintainers, we weren\u2019t sure it would be worth the time investment. Our skepticism was reinforced by the following:\\n\\n1. [Mentions](https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/xvynx9/hacktoberfest_is_ruining_opensource/) of people submitting trivial PRs just to win the award\\n\\n2. The fact that we\'re making a relatively complex project (DSL for developing React + Node.js full-stack web apps with less code) and it might be hard for people to get into it\\n\\n3. The compiler is written is Haskell, with templates in JavaScript - again, not the very common project setup\\n\\nFortunately, none of this turned out to be a problem! We\'ve got 24 valid PRs, both Haskell and non-Haskell, a ton of valuable feedback, and several dozen new users and community members. \\n\\n## Wrap up\\n\\nDon\u2019t expect magic to happen. HacktoberFest is all about smaller changes and getting community introduced to your project. Be ready to promote your repo genuinely and don\u2019t be afraid to take part in the contest.

As you can probably imagine, it\u2019s not easy to get people to use a new piece of technology, especially while still in Alpha. On the other hand, without users and their feedback, it\u2019s impossible to know what to build.\\n\\nThat is why we ran Alpha Testing Program for Wasp - here is what we learned and what went both well and wrong along the way.\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"twitter DM - shared atp in swag groups\\"\\n    source=\\"img/atp/swag-groups-twitter.png\\"\\n/>\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## \u201cOf course I know about Wasp! I just haven\u2019t come around to trying it out yet.\u201d\\n\\nAlthough we hit the front page of HN [several](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26091956) [times](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32098144) and are about to reach 2,000 stars on GitHub, there is still a big difference between a person starring a repo and actually sitting down and building something with it.\\n\\nTalking to people, we realised a lot of them had heard of Wasp, thought it was a neat idea, but hadn\u2019t tried it out. These were the main reasons:\\n\\n- having to find 30 mins to go through our **Build a Todo App** tutorial - *\u201cI\'m busy now, but I\u2019ll do it next week.\u201d*\\n- building a bare-bones todo app is not that exciting\\n- not having an idea what else to build\\n- *\u201cthe product is still in alpha, so I will bookmark it for later\u201d*\\n\\nThese are all obvious and understandable reasons. I must admit, I\u2019m much the same \u2014 maybe even worse \u2014 when it comes to trying out something new/unproven. It just isn\u2019t a priority, and without a push that will help me overcome all these objections, I usually don\u2019t have an incentive to go through with it.\\n\\nHaving realised all that, we understood we needed to give people a reason to try Wasp out **now**, because that\u2019s when we needed the feedback, not next week.\\n\\n## Welcome to Wasp Alpha Testing Program!\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n  <figure>\\n    <img alt=\\"The team\\"\\n        src={useBaseUrl(\'img/atp/welcome-to-atp-notion.png\')}\\n    />\\n    <figcaption style={{color: \'#808080\'}}>I was having a bit too much fun <Link to={useBaseUrl(\'https://wasp-lang.notion.site/CLOSED-Welcome-to-Wasp-Alpha-Testing-program-f3a8a350802341abac87fb7831bb1e60\')}>here</Link>, but Portal fans will understand.</figcaption>\\n  </figure>\\n</p>\\n\\nWe quickly put together an admissions page for alpha testers in Notion (you can see it [here](https://wasp-lang.notion.site/Wasp-Alpha-Testing-Program-Admissions-dca25649d63849cb8dfc55881e4f6f82)) and started sharing it around. To counter the hurdles we mentioned above, we time-boxed the program (*\u201dthis is happening now and you have 48 hours to finish once you start*\u201d) and promised a t-shirt to everyone that goes through the tutorial and fills out the feedback form.\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"Apply to ATP - CTA\\"\\n    source=\\"img/atp/atp-apply-here.png\\"\\n    caption=\\"CTA from the admissions page\\"\\n/>\\n\\nSoon, the first applications started trickling in! For each new applicant, we\u2019d follow up with the [instructions](https://www.notion.so/CLOSED-Welcome-to-Wasp-Alpha-Testing-program-f3a8a350802341abac87fb7831bb1e60) on how to successfully go through the Alpha Testing Program:\\n\\n- fill out intro form (years of experience, preferred stack, etc)\\n- go through our \u201cbuild a Todo app\u201d tutorial\\n- fill out the feedback form - what was good, what was bad etc.\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"Timeboxing\\"\\n    source=\\"img/atp/timeboxing.png\\"\\n    caption=\\"People were really respectful of this deadline and would politely ask to extend it in case they couldn\u2019t make it.\\"\\n/>\\n\\nBut, soon after I got the following message on Twitter:\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"twitter DM - shared atp in swag groups\\"\\n    source=\\"img/atp/swag-groups-twitter.png\\"\\n/>\\n\\nWe got really scared that we would get a ton of folks putting in minimal effort while trying Wasp out just to get the free swag, leaving us empty-handed and having learned nothing! On the other hand, we didn\u2019t have much choice since we didn\u2019t define the \u201cminimum required quality\u201d of feedback in advance.\\n\\nLuckily, it wasn\u2019t the problem in the end, even the opposite -- we did get a surge of applications, but only a portion of them finished the program and the ones that did left really high-quality feedback!\\n\\n## How it went - test profile & feedback\\n\\n### Tester profile\\n\\nWe received 210 applications and 53 out of those completed the program \u2014 25% completion rate.\\n\\nWe also surveyed applicants about their preferred stack, years of programming experience, etc:\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"Intro survey - tester profile\\"\\n    source=\\"img/atp/atp-intro-survey-yoe.png\\"\\n    caption=\\"Yep, we like puns.\\"\\n/>\\n\\n### The feedback\\n\\nThe feedback form evaluated testers\u2019 overall experience with Wasp. We asked them what they found to be the best and worst parts of working with Wasp, as well as about the next features they\u2019d like to see.\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"Feedback survey - experience\\"\\n    source=\\"img/atp/atp-feedback-survey-exp.png\\"\\n/>\\n\\n**The bad parts**\\n\\nWhat our testers were missing the most was a full-blown IDE and TypeScript support. Both of these are coming in Beta but only JS was supported at the time. Plus, there were some installation problems with Windows (which is not fully supported yet \u2014 best to use it through WSL).\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"Feedback survey - the bad parts\\"\\n    source=\\"img/atp/atp-bad-parts.png\\"\\n/>\\n\\nWe were already aware that TypeScript support is an important feature, but didn\u2019t have an exact feeling of how much - the feedback was really helpful and helped us prioritise our Beta backlog.\\n\\n**The good parts**\\n\\nTesters\u2019 favourite part was the batteries-included experience, particularly the [auth model](/docs/tutorials/todo-app/06-auth).\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"Feedback survey - the good parts\\"\\n    source=\\"img/atp/atp-good-parts.png\\"\\n/>\\n\\n## Post-mortem: what didn\u2019t go well\\n\\n### No threshold for feedback quality\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"Feedback quality\\"\\n    source=\\"img/atp/atp-feedback-quality.png\\"\\n/>\\n\\nWe didn\u2019t put any kind of restrictions on the feedback form, e.g. minimal length of the feedback. That resulted in ~15%-20% of answers being single words, such as depicted above. I\u2019m not sure if there is an efficient way to avoid this or just a stat to live with.\\n\\n### Using free text form for collecting addresses\\n\\nIt never crossed our minds before that validating addresses could be such an important part of shipping swag, but turns out it is. It seems that there are a lot of ways to specify an address, some of which are different from what is expected by our post office, resulting in a number of shipments getting returned.\\n\\nAn ideal solution would be to use a specialized \u201caddress\u201d field in a survey that would auto-validate it, but turns out Typeform (which we used) doesn\u2019t have that feature implemented yet, although [it\u2019s been highly requested](https://community.typeform.com/suggestions-feedback-34/address-field-question-type-2950).\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"Shipment returned\\"\\n    source=\\"img/atp/atp-shipment-returned.jpg\\"\\n/>\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"Shipment returned email\\"\\n    source=\\"img/atp/atp-shipment-returned-email.png\\"\\n/>\\n\\n## The non-obvious benefit of Alpha Testing Program\\n\\nWhat went well is that we got a lot of high-quality feedback that steered and fortified our plan for the upcoming Beta release.\\n\\nThe other big benefit is that we finally solved the *\u201clooks cool but i\u2019ll try it out later maybe\u201d* problem. Overall, our usage went well up during the program, but even after it ended, the baseline increased significantly. This was the second-order effect we didn\u2019t foresee.\\n\\nOur understanding is that once people finally gave it a try, a portion of them felt the value first-hand and decided to keep using it for other projects as well.\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"Alpha testing program - usage spike\\"\\n    source=\\"img/atp/atp-usage-spike.png\\"\\n/>\\n\\n## Summary & going forward: Beta\\n\\nThe overall conclusion from our Alpha Testing Program is it was a worthy effort which got us valuable feedback and positively affected the overall usage. Moving forward we\u2019ll try to focus on ensuring more quality feedback and prioritising 1-to-1 communication to make sure we fully understand what bothers Wasp users and what we can improve. It also might be helpful to do testing in smaller batches so we are not overwhelmed with responses and can focus on the individual testers - that\u2019s something we might try out in Beta.\\n\\nAs mentioned, the next stop is Beta!

But the mythical full stack dev is exceedingly rare (or more likely, a lie). Even as someone who falls into the meme category above, we *all* still need to make websites that **look noice**. This is a place where CSS frameworks can help.\\n\\nBut which one should you use? According to our *extensive research*, a statistically-questionable-but-you\u2019re-still-significant-to-us 11 people on Twitter wanted us to add better support for [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/). Which was lucky for us, since we already added it before asking them. \ud83d\ude05\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n  <img alt=\\"Twitter voting\\"\\n      src={useBaseUrl(\'img/tailwind-2.png\')}\\n      width=\\"400px\\"\\n  />\\n</p>\\n\\nOk, it wasn\u2019t a huge stretch for us to do so preemptively. Tailwind is one of the most heavily used CSS frameworks out there today and seems to keep growing in popularity. So how do you integrate it into your Wasp apps? Like many things in Wasp, it\u2019s really easy- just drop in two config files into the root of your project and you can then start using it! Here are the defaults:\\n\\n```jsx title=\\"./tailwind.config.js\\"\\n/** @type {import(\'tailwindcss\').Config} */\\nmodule.exports = {\\n  content: [\\n    \\"./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}\\",\\n  ],\\n  theme: {\\n    extend: {},\\n  },\\n  plugins: [],\\n}\\n```\\n\\n```jsx title=\\"./postcss.config.js\\"\\nmodule.exports = {\\n  plugins: {\\n    tailwindcss: {},\\n    autoprefixer: {},\\n  },\\n}\\n```\\n\\nWhen these two files are present, Wasp will make sure all the required NPM dependencies get added, that [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/) plays nicely with Tailwind directives in CSS files, and that your JavaScript files are properly processed so you can use all the CSS selectors you want (provided you are properly equipped :D).\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n  <img alt=\\"Best monitor\\"\\n      src={useBaseUrl(\'img/tailwind-3.png\')}\\n      width=\\"500px\\"\\n  />\\n</p>\\n\\nWith that in place, you can add the Tailwind directives to your CSS files like so:\\n\\n```css title=\\"./src/client/Main.css\\"\\n@tailwind base;\\n@tailwind components;\\n@tailwind utilities;\\n\\n/* rest of content below */\\n```\\n\\nAnd then start using Tailwind classes in your components:\\n\\n```jsx\\n<h1 className=\\"text-3xl font-bold underline\\">\\n  Hello world!\\n</h1>\\n```\\n\\nAs usual, Wasp will still automatically reload your code and refresh the browser on any changes. \ud83e\udd73\\n\\nLastly, here is a small example that shows how to add a few Tailwind plugins for the adventurous ([wasp file](https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/blob/main/waspc/examples/todoApp/todoApp.wasp#L8-L9) and [Tailwind config](https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/blob/main/waspc/examples/todoApp/tailwind.config.js#L10-L11)), and [here](/docs/integrations/css-frameworks) are the docs for more details.

Your app needs to support user authentication with social login, and you must now decide what to do next. Should you eschew the collective experience and wisdom of the crowd and YOLO it by rolling your own, praying you don\'t get pwned in prod? \\"Nah, I just ate some week-old sushi and can\'t take another risk that big anytime soon.\\", you rightly think.\\n\\nOk, surely you can just use a library, right? Open source software, baby! \\"Hmm, seems Library X, Y, and Z are all somewhat used, each with their pros/cons, nuances, and integration pain points. Oh wait, there are tutorials for each... but each says how hard they are to correctly set up and use. I scoped this feature for one day, not a one-week hair-pulling adventure (Dang scrum! Who likes it anyways? Oh yeah, PMs do. Dang PMs!).\\" Ok, something else. You need to brainstorm. `You instead start to surf Twitter and see an ad for some unicorn auth startup.`\\n\\nEureka, you can go with a third-party SaaS offering! \\"We shouldn\'t have to pay for a while (I ~~think?~~ hope!), and it\'s just another dependency, no biggie... #microservices, right?\\" \\"But what about outages, data privacy, mapping users between systems, and all that implicit trust you are placing in them?\\" you think. \\"What happens when Elon buys them next?\\" You gasp as if you walked by a Patagonia vest covered in that hot new *Burnt Hair* cologne.\\n\\n\\"All I want is username and password auth with Google login support, why is that so hard in 2022?!? I miss Basic HTTP auth headers. I think I\'ll move off the grid and become a woodworker.\\"\\n\\n## Easy auth setup in Wasp\\n\\nWasp helps that dev by taking care of the entire auth setup process out of the box. Adding support for username and password auth, plus Google login, is super quick and easy for Wasp apps. We think this makes adding auth fast and convenient, with no external dependencies or frustrating manual configuration. Here\u2019s how it works:\\n\\n### Step 1 - Add the appropriate models\\n\\nWe need to store user info and the external mapping association for social logins.

In his free time, he enjoys playing poker, chess and [winning](https://www.smudailycampus.com/news/smu-graduate-julian-laneve-wins-100k-grand-prize-from-data-science-competition) data science competitions.\\n\\nHis project, [Farnance](https://farnance.netlify.app/), is a SaaS marketplace that allows farmers to transform their production into a digital asset on blockchain. Julian and his team developed Farnance as a part of the London Business School\u2019s annual hackathon [HackLBS 2021](https://hacklbs.devpost.com/), and ended up as winners among more than 250 participants competing for 6 prizes in total!\\n\\nRead on to learn why Julian chose Wasp to develop and deploy Farnance and what parts he enjoyed the most.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Finding a perfect React & Node.js hackathon setup\\n\\nJulian had previous experiences with React and Node.js and loved that he could use JavaScript across the stack, but setting up a new project and making sure it uses all the latest packages (and then also figuring out how to deploy it) was always a pain. Since the hackathon only lasted for two days, he needed a quick way to get started but still have the freedom to use his favourite stack.\\n\\n## The power of one-line auth and No-API approach\\n\\nJulian first learned about Wasp when it [launched on HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26091956) and decided it would be a perfect tool for his case. The whole app setup, across the full stack, is covered out-of-the-box, simply by typing `wasp new farnance`, and he is ready to start writing own React & Node.js code.\\n\\nExcept on the app setup, the team saved a ton of time by not needing to implement the authentication and a typical CRUD API, since it is covered by Wasp as well. They could also deploy everything for free on Heroku and Netlify in just a few steps, which was a perfect fit for a hackathon.\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"Julian\'s testimonial on Discord\\"\\n    source=\\"img/farnance/julian-discord-testimonial.png\\"\\n/>\\n\\nFarnance is still running and you can [try it out here](https://farnance.netlify.app/)! The source code is also [publicly available](https://github.com/jlaneve/Farnance), although note it is running on older version of Wasp so some things are a bit different.\\n\\n## Spend more time developing features and less time reinventing the wheel\\n\\nJulian was amazed by how fast he was able to get Farnance of the ground and share a working web app with the users! He decided to go with Google\'s material-ui for an UI framework which gave his app an instant professional look, although they didn\u2019t have a dedicated designer on the team.\\n\\nWith all the common web app features (setup, auth, CRUD API) being taken care of by Wasp out-of-the-box they could invest all the time saved in developing and refining their unique features which in the end brought them victory!\\n\\n> I\u2019ve done plenty of hackathons before where I\u2019ve built small SaaS apps, and there\u2019s just so much time wasted setting up common utilities - stuff like user management, databases, routing, etc. Wasp handled all that for me and let me build out our web app in record time\\n>\\n> \u2014 Julian LaNeve - Farnance\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"Farnance\'s dashboard\\"\\n    source=\\"img/farnance/farnance-dashboard.png\\"\\n    caption=\\"Farnance dashboard in action!\\"\\n/>\\n\\n\\n## Start quickly, but also scale without worries\\n\\n:::note\\nHeroku used to offer free apps under certain limits. However, as of November 28, 2022, they ended support for their free tier. https://blog.heroku.com/next-chapter\\n\\nAs such, we have updated our Deployment docs with new recommendations: https://wasp-lang.dev/docs/deploying\\n:::\\n\\nSince Wasp compiler generates a full-stack React & Node.js app under the hood, there aren\u2019t any technical limitations to scaling Julian\u2019s app as it grows and gets more users in the future. By running `wasp build` inside a project folder, developers gets both frontend files and a Dockerfile for the backend, which can then be deployed as any regular web app to the platform of your choice.\\n\\nWasp provides [step-by step instructions](/docs/deploying) on how to do it with Netlify and Fly.io for free, but we plan to add even more examples and more integrated deployment experience in the coming releases!\\n\\n> Deploying the wasp app was incredibly easy - I didn\u2019t have time to stand up full infrastructure in the 2 day hackathon and don\u2019t have an infra/devops background, but I had something running on Netlify within an hour. Other projects at the hackathon struggled to do this, and putting access in the hands of the judges certainly helped get us 1st place.\\n>\\n> \u2014 Julian LaNeve - Farnance"},{"id":"/2022/09/29/journey-to-1000-gh-stars","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2022/09/29/journey-to-1000-gh-stars","editUrl":"https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/edit/main/web/blog/blog/2022-09-29-journey-to-1000-gh-stars.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-09-29-journey-to-1000-gh-stars.md","title":"How Wasp reached 1,000 stars on GitHub (detailed stats & timeline)","description":"Wasp is an open-source configuration language for building full-stack web apps that integrates with React & Node.js.

We launched first prototype 2 years ago, currently are at 1.9k stars on GitHub and will be releasing Beta in the coming months.\\n\\nIt was very hard for us to find and be able to learn from early inception stories of successful OSS projects and that\'s why we want to share what it looked like for Wasp.\\n\\n\\n![1k stars chart](../static/img/1000-gh-stars/1k_gh_stars_chart.png)\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Before the stars: Is this really a problem? (1 year)\\n\\nMy co-founder and twin brother Martin and I got an initial idea for Wasp in 2018, while developing a web platform for running bioinformatics analysis in the cloud for one London-based startup.\\n\\nIt was our third or fourth time creating a full-stack app from scratch with the latest & hottest stack. This time, it was React/Node.js; for our previous projects, we went through PHP/Java/Node.js on the back-end and jQuery/Backbone/Angular on the front-end. Because Martin and I felt we were spending a lot of time relearning how to use the latest stack just to build the same features all over again (auth, CRUD, forms, async jobs, etc.), we asked ourselves: *Why not abstract these common functionalities in a stack-agnostic, higher-level language (like e.g. SQL does for databases) to never reimplement them again?*\\n\\nBefore we jumped into coding, we wanted to make sure this is a problem that actually exists and that we understand it well (enough). In our previous startup we found Customer Development (aka talking to users) extremely helpful, so we decided to do it again for Wasp.\\n\\nIn a month or so we conducted 25 problem interviews, probing around \u201cWhat is your biggest challenge with web app development?\u201d After we compiled the results, we identified the following four problems as the most significant ones and decided to focus on them in our v1:\\n\\n- It is hard to **quickly start** a new web app and make sure **the best practices are being followed**.\\n- There is a lot of duplication/boilerplate in **managing the state** across front-end, back-end, and the database.\\n- A lot of **common features are re-implemented** for every new app.\\n- Developers are overwhelmed by the **increasing tool complexity** and don\'t want to be responsible for managing it.\\n\\nWe also clustered the answers we got by topics, so we could dive deeper and identify the areas that got the most attention:\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"Start and setup of a web app - problems\\"\\n    source=\\"img/1000-gh-stars/wasp-cust-dev-start-and-setup.png\\"\\n    caption=\\"Interviewee problems regarding starting and setting up a new web app.\\"\\n/>\\nThe reason why we stopped at 25 was that the answers started repeating themselves. We felt that we identified the initial patterns and were ready to move on.\\n\\n## 0-180 \u2b50\ufe0f: First Contact (7 months)\\nAfter confirming and clarifying the problem with other developers, Martin and I felt we finally deserved to do some coding. (Ok, I admit, we had actually already started, but the interviews made us feel better about it \ud83d\ude00). We created a new repo on GitHub and started setting up the tooling & playing around with the concept.\\n\\nFor the next couple of months, we treated Wasp as a side project/experiment and didn\u2019t do any marketing. However, we were well aware of how crucial external feedback is. So, once we built a very rudimentary code generation functionality, we also created a project page that we could share with others to explain what we\u2019re working on and ask for feedback.\\n\\nAt that point, we came up with the first \u201creal\u201d name for Wasp - **STIC: Specification To Implementation Compiler**, as the big vision for Wasp was to be a stack-agnostic, specification language from which we could generate the actual code in e.g. React & Node.js or even some other stack.\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"STIC - first project page\\"\\n    source=\\"img/1000-gh-stars/stic-project-page.png\\"\\n    caption=\\"Our first page for Wasp! Not the best at explaining what Wasp does, though.\\"\\n/>\\n\\n### Baby steps on Reddit and Hacker News\\n\\nOur preferred way of distributing STIC project page was through relevant subreddits - r/webdev, r/coding, r/javascript, r/Haskell, r/ProgrammingLanguages, \u2026. \\n\\n[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/f38h1t/askjs_we_are_developing_a_declarative_dsl_for/) was the first Reddit post we\u2019ve ever made about Wasp:\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"First Wasp post on Reddit\\"\\n    source=\\"img/1000-gh-stars/wasp-reddit-first-post.png\\"\\n    caption=\\"Our first Reddit post! We managed to get some feedback before we got banned.\\"\\n/>\\n\\nOne important thing we learned is that Reddit doesn\u2019t like self-promotion. Sometimes, even if you\u2019re only asking for feedback, the mods (and bots) will see it as self-promo and ban your post. It depends a lot on the mods, though. Reaching out to them and asking for explanation sometimes helps, but not very often. All subreddits have their own rules and guidelines that describe when or how it is OK to post about your project (e.g., /r/webdev has \u201cShowoff Saturdays\u201d), and we tried to follow them as best as we could.\\n\\nAfter Reddit, we also launched on HN. This was our first ever launch there! We scored 20 points and received a few motivating comments:\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"First Wasp post on Reddit\\"\\n    source=\\"img/1000-gh-stars/first-hn-launch.png\\"\\n/>\\n\\n### Listening to users\\nMartin and I also followed up with the people we had previously interviewed about their problems in web dev. We showed them STIC project page and asked for comments. From all the feedback we captured, we identified the following issues:\\n\\n- **Developers were not familiar with a term \u201cDSL.\u201d** Almost all of us use a DSL on a daily basis (e.g., SQL, HCL (Terraform), HTML), but it\u2019s not a popular term.\\n- **Developers feared learning a new programming language**. Although our goal was never to replace e.g. Java or Typescript but to make Wasp work alongside it, we discovered that we had failed to communicate it well. Our messaging made developers feel they have to drop all their previous knowledge and start from scratch if they want to use Wasp.\\n- **Nobody could try Wasp yet + there wasn\u2019t any documentation besides the project page**. Our code was public, but we didn\u2019t have a build/distribution system yet. Only a devoted Haskell developer could build it from the source. This made it hard for developers to buy into the high-level vision, as there was nothing they could hold onto. Web frameworks/languages are very \u201ctactile\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s hard to judge one without trying it out.\\n\\n## 180-300 \u2b50\ufe0f : Anybody can try Wasp out + Docs = Alpha! (3 months)\\nAfter processing this feedback, we realized that the next step for us was to get Wasp into the condition where developers can easily try it out without needing any extra knowledge or facing the trouble of compiling from the source. That meant polishing things a bit, adding a few crucial features, and writing our first documentation, so that users would know how to use it.\\n\\nTo write our docs, we picked [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) \u2014 an OSS writing platform made by Facebook. We saw several other OSS projects using it for their docs + its ability to import React in your markdown was amazing. Docusaurus gave us a lot of initial structure, design and features (e.g., search), saving us from reinventing the wheel.\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"First Wasp docs\\"\\n    source=\\"img/1000-gh-stars/first-docs.png\\"\\n    caption=\\"Martin made sure to add a huge Alpha warning sign :D\\"\\n/>\\n\\nOur M.O. at the time was to focus pretty much exclusively on one thing, either development or community. Since Wasp team consisted of only Martin and me, it was really hard to do multiple things at once. After the docs were out and Wasp was ready to be easily downloaded, we called this version \u201cAlpha\u201d and switched once again into the \u201ccommunity\u201d mode.\\n\\n## 300-570 \u2b50\ufe0f : Big break on Reddit and Product Hunt (2 months)\\n\\nOnce Alpha was out, we [launched again on HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/submitted?id=matijash) and drew a bit of attention (34 upvotes and 3 comments). However, that was little compared to our Reddit launches, where we scored 263 upvotes on [r/javascript](https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/jvv1yg/together_with_my_brother_ive_been_working_on_wasp/) and 365 upvotes on [r/reactjs](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/jx5fyg/together_with_my_brother_ive_been_working_on_wasp/):\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"Big break on Reddit\\"\\n    source=\\"img/1000-gh-stars/reddit-big-break.png\\"\\n    caption=\\"They love me! [insert Tobey Maguire as Spiderman]\\"\\n/>\\n\\nCompared to the volume of attention and feedback we\u2019ve been previously receiving, this was a big surprise for us! Here are some of the changes in messaging that we made for the Reddit launches:\\n\\n- **Put prefix \u201cdeclarative\u201d in front of the \u201clanguage\u201d** to convey that it\u2019s not a regular programming language like Python or Javascript but rather something much more lightweight and specialized.\\n- **Emphasized that Wasp is not a standalone language that will replace your current stack** but rather a \u201cglue\u201d between your React & Node.js code, allowing you to keep using your favourite stack.\\n- **Focused on the benefits like \u201cless boilerplate,\u201d** which is a well known pain in web development.\\n\\n:::tip Docs made the difference\\n \\nOnce we added the docs, we noticed a peculiar thing: **developers became much less trigger-happy to criticize the project, especially in a non-constructive way**. Our feeling was the majority of developers who were checking Wasp out still didn\u2019t read the docs in detail (or at all), but the sheer existence of them made them feel there is more content they should go through before passing the final judgment.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n### Winning #1 Product of The Day on Product Hunt\\n\\nAfter HN and Reddit, we continued with the \u201cAlpha launch\u201d mindset and set ourselves to launch Wasp on Product Hunt. It was our first time ever launching on PH, so we didn\u2019t know what to expect. We googled some advice, did maybe a week of preparation (i.e., wrote the copy, asked a few friends to share their experiences with Wasp once we\u2019re live), and that was it.\\n\\nWe launched [Wasp on PH on Dec 6, 2020](https://www.producthunt.com/products/wasp-lang-alpha#wasp-lang-alpha) and it ended up as Product of the day! That gave us a boost in stars and overall traction. Another benefit of PH was that Wasp also ended up in their daily newsletter, which supposedly has over a million subscribers. All this gave us quite a boost and visibility increase.\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"Product Hunt launch\\"\\n    source=\\"img/1000-gh-stars/ph-launch.png\\"\\n/>\\n\\n## 570-1000 \u2b50\ufe0f : Wasp joins YC + \u201cOfficial\u201d HN launch (2.5 months)\\n\\nSoon after Product Hunt, Wasp joined Y Combinator for their W21 batch. We had applied two times before and always made it to the interviews, but did not get in. This time, the traction tipped the scales in our favour. (You can read more about our journey to YC [here](https://wasp-lang.dev/blog/2021/02/23/journey-to-ycombinator).)\\n\\nFor the first month of YC, there was a lot of admin and setup work to deal with alongside the regular program. That added a third dimension to our existing two areas of effort. Once we went past that, we could again put more focus on product and community development. \\n\\nOur next milestone was to launch Wasp on Hacker News, but this time \u201cofficially\u201d as a YC-backed company. **Hacker News provides a lot of [good tips](https://news.ycombinator.com/yli.html) on how to successfully launch and 80% of the advice applies even if your product isn\u2019t backed by YC**. I wish I had known about it before. The gist of the advice is to write in a clear and succinct way and to avoid buzzwords, superlatives, and salesy tone above all. Consider HN readers as your peers and explain what you do in a way you would talk to a friend over a drink. It really works that way.\\n\\nWe went through the several iterations of the text, sweated over how it\u2019s gonna go, and when the day finally came \u2014 we launched! It went beyond all our expectations. With 222 points and 79 comments, **our HN launch was one of the most successful launches (#9) out of 300+ companies in the W21 batch.** Many developers and VCs that checked our launch afterwards were surprised how much positive feedback Wasp received, especially given how honest and direct HN audience can be.\\n\\n**HN launch brought us about 200 stars right away**, and the rest came in the following weeks. As it was February and the YC program was nearing its end, we  needed to shift gears again and focus on fundraising. This put all the other efforts on the back burner. (You can read about our fundraising learnings from 250+ meetings in 98 days [here](https://wasp-lang.dev/blog/2021/11/22/fundraising-learnings).) But the interest of the community remained and even without much activity from our side they kept coming and trying Wasp out.\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"YC HN launch\\"\\n    source=\\"img/1000-gh-stars/yc-hn-launch.png\\"\\n/>\\n\\n## Conclusion: understanding users > number of stars\\n\\nOur primary goal was never to reach X stars, but rather to understand how we can make Wasp more helpful so that developers would want to use it for their projects. As you could read above, even well before we started a repository we made sure to talk to developers and learn about their problems.\\n\\nWe also kept continually improving how we present Wasp - had we not pivoted our message from *\u201cWasp is a new programming language\u201d* to *\u201cWasp is a simple config language that works alongside React & Node.js\u201d* we wouldn\u2019t have been where we are today.\\n\\nOn the other hand, stars have become an unofficial \u201ccurrency\u201d of GitHub and developers and VCs alike consider it when evaluating a project. They shouldn\u2019t be disregarded and you should make it easy for users who like your product to express their support by starring your repo (like I\u2019m doing right [here](https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp)), but that should always be a second order of concern.\\n\\n## Good luck!\\n\\nI hope you found this helpful and that we shed some light on how things can look like in the early stages of an OSS project.

In the quickest possible way, so we can\u2019t excuse ourselves from building it!\\n\\n![Best excuse of all time](../static/img/compiling.png)\\n\\nBest excuse of all time! [Taken from here.](https://xkcd.com/303/)\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## The requirements were unclear.\\n\\nWe\u2019ll use Michele Gerarduzzi\u2019s [open-source project](https://github.com/michelegera/devexcuses-api). It provides a simple API and a solid number of predefined excuses. A perfect fit for our needs. Let\u2019s define the requirements for the project: \\n\\n- The app should be able to pull excuses data from a public API. \\n- Save the ones you liked (and your boss doesn\'t) to the database for future reference.\\n- Building an app shouldn\u2019t take more than 15 minutes.\\n- Use modern web dev technologies (NodeJS + React)\\n\\nAs a result \u2013 we\u2019ll get a simple and fun pet project. You can find the complete codebase [here](https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/tree/release/examples/tutorials/ItWaspsOnMyMachine). \\n\\n![Final result](../static/img/final-excuse-app.png)\\n\\n\\n## There\u2019s an issue with the third party library.\\n\\nSetting up a backbone for the project is the most frustrating part of building any application. \\n\\nWe are installing dependencies, tying up the back-end and front-end, setting up a database, managing connection strings, and so on. Avoiding this part will save us a ton of time and effort. So let\u2019s find ourselves an excuse to skip the initial project setup.\\n\\nIdeally \u2013 use a framework that will create a project infrastructure quickly with the best defaults so that we\u2019ll focus on the business logic. A perfect candidate is [Wasp](https://wasp-lang.dev/). It\u2019s an open-source, declarative DSL for building web apps in React and Node.js with no boilerplate\\n\\nHow it works: developer starts from a single config file that specifies the app architecture. Routes, CRUD API, auth, and so on. Then adds React/Node.js code for the specific business logic. Behind the scenes, Wasp compiler will produce the entire source code of the app - back-end, front-end, deployment template, database migrations and everything else you\u2019ve used to have in any other full-stack app. \\n\\n![Wasp architecture](../static/img/wasp-compilation.png)\\n\\nSo let\u2019s jump right in.\\n\\n\\n## Maybe something\'s wrong with the environment.\\n\\nWasp intentionally works with the LTS Node.js version since it guarantees stability and active maintenance. As for now, it\u2019s Node 16 and NPM 8. If you need another Node version for some other project \u2013 there\u2019s a possibility to [use NVM](https://wasp-lang.dev/docs#1-requirements) to manage multiple Node versions on your computer at the same time.\\n\\nInstalling Wasp on Linux (for Mac/Windows, please [check the docs](https://wasp-lang.dev/docs#2-installation)):\\n```\\ncurl -sSL https://get.wasp-lang.dev/installer.sh | sh\\n```\\n\\nNow let\u2019s create a new web app named ItWaspsOnMyMachine.\\n```\\nwasp new ItWaspsOnMyMachine\\n```\\n\\nChanging the working directory:\\n```\\ncd ItWaspsOnMyMachine\\n```\\n\\nStarting the app:\\n```\\nwasp start\\n```\\n\\nNow your default browser should open up with a simple predefined text message. That\u2019s it! \ud83e\udd73 We\u2019ve built and run a NodeJS + React application. And for now \u2013 the codebase consists of only two files! `main.wasp` is the config file that defines the application\u2019s functionality. And `MainPage.js` is the front-end.\\n\\n![Initial page](../static/img/init-page.png)\\n\\n\\n## That worked perfectly when I developed it.\\n\\n\\n**1) Let\u2019s add some additional configuration to our `main.wasp` file. So it will look like this:**\\n\\n```js title=\\"main.wasp | Defining Excuse entity, queries and action\\"\\n\\n// Main declaration, defines a new web app.\\napp ItWaspsOnMyMachine {\\n  // Wasp compiler configuration\\n  wasp: {\\n    version: \\"^0.6.0\\"\\n  },\\n\\n  // Used as a browser tab title.                                  \\n  title: \\"It Wasps On My Machine\\",\\n\\n  head: [\\n    // Adding Tailwind to make our UI prettier\\n    \\"<script src=\'https://cdn.tailwindcss.com\'><\/script>\\"\\n  ],\\n\\n  dependencies: [ \\n    // Adding Axios for making HTTP requests                                          \\n    (\\"axios\\", \\"^0.21.1\\")\\n  ]\\n}\\n\\n// Render page MainPage on url `/` (default url).\\nroute RootRoute { path: \\"/\\", to: MainPage }                 \\n\\n// ReactJS implementation of our page located in `src/client/MainPage.js` as a default export.\\npage MainPage {                                             \\n  component: import Main from \\"@client/MainPage.js\\"\\n}\\n\\n// Prisma database entity\\nentity Excuse {=psl                                          \\n    id          Int     @id @default(autoincrement())\\n    text        String\\npsl=}\\n\\n// Query declaration to get a new excuse\\nquery getExcuse {                                           \\n  fn: import { getExcuse } from \\"@server/queries.js\\",\\n  entities: [Excuse]\\n}\\n\\n// Query declaration to get all excuses\\nquery getAllSavedExcuses {                                  \\n  fn: import { getAllSavedExcuses } from \\"@server/queries.js\\",\\n  entities: [Excuse]\\n}\\n\\n// Action to save current excuse\\naction saveExcuse {                                         \\n  fn: import { saveExcuse } from \\"@server/actions.js\\",\\n  entities: [Excuse]\\n}\\n```\\n\\nWe\u2019ve added Tailwind to make our UI more pretty and Axios for making API requests. \\n\\nAlso, we\u2019ve declared a database entity called `Excuse`, queries, and action. The `Excuse` entity consists of the entity\u2019s ID and the text. \\n\\n`Queries` are here when we need to fetch/read something, while `actions` are here when we need to change/update data. Both query and action declaration consists of two lines \u2013 a reference to the file that contains implementation and a data model to operate on. You can find more info [in the docs](https://wasp-lang.dev/docs/tutorials/todo-app/listing-tasks#introducing-operations-queries-and-actions). So let\u2019s proceed with queries/actions. \\n\\n\\n**2) Create two files: \u201cactions.js\u201d and \u201cqueries.js\u201d in the `src/server` folder.**\\n\\n```js title=\\"src/server/actions.js | Defining an action\\"\\nexport const saveExcuse = async (excuse, context) => {\\n  return context.entities.Excuse.create({\\n    data: { text: excuse.text }\\n  })\\n}\\n```\\n\\n```js title=\\"src/server/queries.js | Defining queries\\"\\nimport axios from \'axios\';\\n\\nexport const getExcuse = async () => {\\n  const response = await axios.get(\'https://api.devexcus.es/\')\\n  return response.data\\n}\\n\\nexport const getAllSavedExcuses = async (_args, context) => {\\n  return context.entities.Excuse.findMany()\\n}\\n```\\n\\nLet\u2019s add `saveExcuse()` action to our `actions.js` file. This action will save the text of our excuse to the database. Then let\u2019s create two queries in the `queries.js` file. First, one `getExcuse` will call an external API and fetch a new excuse. The second one, named `getAllSavedExcuses`, will pull all the excuses we\u2019ve saved to our database. \\n\\nThat\u2019s it! We finished our back-end. \ud83c\udf89 Now, let\u2019s use those queries/actions on our UI.\\n\\n\\n**3) Let\u2019s erase everything we had in the `MainPage.js` file and substitute it with our new UI.**\\n\\n```js title=\\"src/client/MainPage.js | Updating the UI\\"\\nimport React, { useState } from \'react\'\\nimport { useQuery } from \'@wasp/queries\'\\nimport getExcuse from \'@wasp/queries/getExcuse\'\\nimport getAllSavedExcuses from \'@wasp/queries/getAllSavedExcuses\'\\nimport saveExcuse from \'@wasp/actions/saveExcuse\'\\n\\nconst MainPage = () => {\\n  const [currentExcuse, setCurrentExcuse] = useState({ text: \\"\\" })\\n  const { data: excuses } = useQuery(getAllSavedExcuses)\\n\\n  const handleGetExcuse = async () => {\\n    try {\\n      setCurrentExcuse(await getExcuse())\\n    } catch (err) {\\n      window.alert(\'Error while getting the excuse: \' + err.message)\\n    }\\n  }\\n\\n  const handleSaveExcuse = async () => {\\n    if (currentExcuse.text) {\\n      try {\\n        await saveExcuse(currentExcuse)\\n      } catch (err) {\\n        window.alert(\'Error while saving the excuse: \' + err.message)\\n      }\\n    }\\n  }\\n\\n  return (\\n    <div className=\\"grid grid-cols-2 text-3xl\\">\\n      <div>\\n          <button onClick={handleGetExcuse} className=\\"mx-2 my-1 p-2 bg-blue-600 hover:bg-blue-400 text-white rounded\\"> Get excuse </button>\\n          <button onClick={handleSaveExcuse} className=\\"mx-2 my-1 p-2 bg-blue-600 hover:bg-blue-400 text-white rounded\\"> Save excuse </button>\\n        <Excuse excuse={currentExcuse} />\\n      </div>\\n      <div>\\n        <div className=\\"px-6 py-2 bg-blue-600 text-white\\"> Saved excuses: </div>\\n        {excuses && <ExcuseList excuses={excuses} />}\\n      </div>\\n    </div>\\n  )\\n}\\n\\nconst ExcuseList = (props) => { \\n  return props.excuses?.length ?  props.excuses.map((excuse, idx) => <Excuse excuse={excuse} key={idx} />) : \'No saved excuses\'\\n}\\n\\nconst Excuse = ({ excuse }) => {\\n  return (\\n    <div className=\\"px-6 py-2\\">\\n      {excuse.text}\\n    </div>\\n  )\\n}\\n\\nexport default MainPage\\n```\\n\\nOur page consists of three components. `MainPage`, `ExcuseList` and `Excuse`. It may seem at first that this file is pretty complex. It\u2019s not, so let\u2019s look a bit closer. \\n\\n`Excuse` is just a div with an excuse text, `ExcuseList` checks if there are any excuses. If the list is empty \u2013 show a message `No saved excuses`. In other case \u2013 excuses will be displayed. \\n\\n`MainPage` contains info about the current excuses and the list of already saved excuses. Two buttons click handlers `handleGetExcuse` and `handleSaveExcuse`. Plus, the markup itself with some Tailwind flavor. \\n\\n\\n**4) Before starting an app \u2013 we need to execute database migration because we changed the DB schema by adding new entities. If you\u2019ve had something running in the terminal \u2013 stop it and run:**\\n\\n```\\nwasp db migrate-dev\\n```\\n\\nYou\u2019ll be prompted to enter a name for the migration. Something like `init` will be ok. Now we can start the application!\\n\\n```\\nwasp start\\n```\\n\\n![Final empty result](../static/img/final-result.png)\\n\\nNow you can click the \u201cGet excuse\u201d button to receive an excuse. And save the ones you like into the DB with the \u201cSave excuse\u201d button. Our final project should look like this:\\n\\n![Final result](../static/img/final-excuse-app.png)\\n\\n\\n## It would have taken twice as long to build it properly.\\n\\nNow we can think of some additional improvements. For example:\\n \\n- 1) Add a unique constraint to Entity\u2019s ID so we won\u2019t be able to save duplicated excuses. \\n- 2) Add exceptions and edge cases handling. \\n- 3) Make the markup prettier.\\n- 4) Optimize and polish the code \\n\\nSo, we\u2019ve been able to build a full-stack application with a database and external API call in a couple of minutes. And now we have a box full of excuses for all our development needs. \\n\\n![Box of excuses for the win!](../static/img/accessible-website-excuse.jpg)\\n\\n<InBlogCta />"},{"id":"/2022/09/02/how-to-get-started-with-haskell-in-2022","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2022/09/02/how-to-get-started-with-haskell-in-2022","editUrl":"https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/edit/main/web/blog/blog/2022-09-02-how-to-get-started-with-haskell-in-2022.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-09-02-how-to-get-started-with-haskell-in-2022.md","title":"How to get started with Haskell in 2022 (the straightforward way)","description":"Haskell is a unique and beautiful language that is worth learning, if for nothing else, then just for the concepts it introduces and their potential to expand your view on programming.","date":"2022-09-02T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"September 2, 2022","tags":[{"label":"webdev","permalink":"/blog/tags/webdev"},{"label":"haskell","permalink":"/blog/tags/haskell"},{"label":"language","permalink":"/blog/tags/language"}],"readingTime":6.795,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Martin Sosic","title":"Co-founder & CTO @ Wasp","url":"https://github.com/martinsos","imageURL":"https://github.com/martinsos.png","key":"martinsos"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"How to get started with Haskell in 2022 (the straightforward way)","authors":["martinsos"],"tags":["webdev","haskell","language"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Building an app to find an excuse for our sloppy work","permalink":"/blog/2022/09/05/dev-excuses-app-tutrial"},"nextItem":{"title":"How and why I got started with Haskell","permalink":"/blog/2022/08/26/how-and-why-i-got-started-with-haskell"}},"content":"import Link from \'@docusaurus/Link\';\\nimport useBaseUrl from \'@docusaurus/useBaseUrl\';\\nimport InBlogCta from \'./components/InBlogCta\';\\nimport WaspIntro from \'./_wasp-intro.md\';\\nimport ImgWithCaption from \'./components/ImgWithCaption\'\\n\\n\\nHaskell is a unique and beautiful language that is worth learning, if for nothing else, then just for the concepts it introduces and their potential to expand your view on programming.\\n\\nI have been programming in Haskell on and off since 2011 and professionally for the past 2 years, building a [compiler](https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp). While in that time Haskell has become much more beginner-friendly, I keep seeing beginners who are overwhelmed by numerous popular options for build tools, installers, introductory educational resources, and similar. [Haskell\u2019s homepage](https://www.haskell.org/) getting a call from the previous decade to give them their UX back :D also doesn\u2019t help!\\n\\nThat is why I decided to write this opinionated and practical post that will tell you exactly how to get started with Haskell in 2022 in the most standard / common way. Instead of worrying about decisions that you are not equipped to make at the moment (e.g. \u201cwhat is the best build tool?\u201d), you can focus on enjoying learning Haskell :)!\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## TLDR / Super opinionated summary\\n\\n1. For setup, use [GHCup](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/). Install GHC, HLS, and cabal.\\n2. As a build tool, use [cabal](https://cabal.readthedocs.io/).\\n3. For editor, use VS Code with [Haskell extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=haskell.haskell). Or, use emacs/vim/....\\n4. Join [r/haskell](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/). Feel free to ask for help!\\n5. To learn the basics of Haskell, read the [LYAH](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) book and [build a blog generator in Haskell](https://lhbg-book.link/). Focus on getting through stuff instead of understanding everything fully; you will come back to it later again.\\n\\n## 1. Setup: Use GHCup for seamless installation\\n\\n[GHCup](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/#) is a universal installer for Haskell. It will install everything you need to program in Haskell and will help you manage those installations in the future (update, switch versions, and similar). It is simple to use and works the same way on Linux, macOS, and Windows. It gives you a single central place/method to take care of your Haskell installation so that you don\u2019t have to deal with OS-specific issues.\\n\\nTo install it, follow instructions at [GHCup](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/#). Then, use it to install the Haskell Toolchain (aka stuff that you need to program in Haskell). \\n\\nHaskell Toolchain consists of:\\n\\n1. GHC -> Haskell compiler\\n2. HLS -> Haskell Language Server -> your code editor will use this to provide you with a great experience while editing Haskell code\\n3. cabal -> Haskell build tool -> you will use this to organize your Haskell projects, build them, run them, define dependencies, etc.\\n4. Stack -> cabal alternative, which you won\u2019t need for now since we\u2019ll go with cabal as our build tool of choice\\n\\n## 2. Build tool: Use cabal\\n\\nThere are two popular build tools for Haskell: [cabal](https://cabal.readthedocs.io/) and [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/). Both are widely used and have their pros and cons. So, one of the hard choices beginners often face is which one to use.\\n\\nSome time ago, cabal was somewhat hard to use (complex, \u201cdependency hell\u201d). That\u2019s why Stack was created: a user-friendly build tool that solves some of the common issues of cabal. (Interestingly, Stack uses cabal\u2019s core library as its backend!) However, as Stack was being developed, cabal advanced, too. Many of its issues have been solved, making it a viable choice for beginners.\\n\\nIn 2022, I recommend `cabal` to beginners. I find it a bit easier to understand when starting out (no resolvers), it works well out of the box with GHCup and the rest of the ecosystem, and it seems to be better maintained lately. \\n\\n## 3. Editor: VS Code is a safe bet\\n\\nHLS (Haskell Language Server) brings all the cool IDE features to your editor. So, as long as your editor has a decent Haskell language extension that utilizes HLS, you are good.\\n\\nThe safest bet is to go with **Visual Studio Code** \u2014 it has a great [Haskell extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=haskell.haskell) that usually works out of the box. A lot of Haskell programmers also use Emacs and Vim. I can confirm they also have good support for Haskell. \\n\\n## 4. Community: r/haskell and more\\n\\nHaskell community is a great place to ask for help and learn about new developments in the  ecosystem. I prefer [r/haskell](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/) -> it tracks all the newest events and no question goes unanswered. There is also [Haskell Discourse](https://discourse.haskell.org/), where a lot of discussions happen, including the more official ones. A lot of Haskellers are still active on [IRC](https://wiki.haskell.org/IRC_channel), but I find it too complex and outdated to use.\\n\\n*Check [https://www.haskell.org/community](https://www.haskell.org/community) for a full list of Haskell communities.*\\n\\n## 5. Learning: You don\u2019t need a math degree, just grab a book\\n\\nThere is a common myth going around that you need a special knowledge of math (PhD in category theory!) to be able to program in Haskell properly. From my experience, this is as far from the truth as it can be. It is certainly not needed, and I seriously doubt it helps even if you have it. Maybe for some very advanced Haskell stuff, but certainly not for junior/intermediate level.\\n\\nInstead, learning Haskell is the same as learning other languages -> you need a healthy mix of theory and practice. The main difference is that there will be more unusual/new concepts than you are used to, which will require some additional effort. But these new concepts are also what makes learning Haskell so fun!\\n\\nI recommend starting with a book for beginners, [LYAH](http://learnyouahaskell.com/). It has an online version that you can read for free, or you can buy a printed version if you like physical books.\\n\\nIf you don\'t like LYAH, consider other popular books for beginners (none of them are free though):\\n\\n1. [Haskell Programming from first principles](https://haskellbook.com/)\\n2. [Get Programming with Haskell](https://www.manning.com/books/get-programming-with-haskell)\\n3. [Programming in Haskell](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Haskell-Graham-Hutton/dp/1316626229)\\n\\nWhatever book you go with, don\u2019t get stuck for too long on concepts that are confusing to you, especially towards the end of the book. Some concepts will just need time to click; don\u2019t expect to grasp it all on the first try. Whatever you do grasp from the first read will likely be more than enough to get going with your first projects in Haskell. You can always come back to those complex concepts later and understand them better. Also, don\u2019t be shy to ask the community -> there are many Haskellers out there happy to support you in your learning!\\n:::note\\nWhen I say \\"don\'t get stuck\\", I don\'t mean you should skip the difficult concept after the first hurdle. No, you should spend some hours experimenting, looking at it from different angles, playing with it, trying to crack it. But you shouldn\'t spend days trying to understand the same concept (e.g. function as a monad) and then feel defeated due to not grasping it 100%. Instead, if you put proper effort but stuff is not completely clicking, tap yourself on the back and move on for now.\\n:::\\n\\nOnce you take the first pass through the book, I recommend doing a project or two. You can come up with an idea yourself, or you can follow one of the books that guide you through it. \\n\\nFor example:\\n\\n1. [Learn Haskell by building a blog generator](https://lhbg-book.link/) -> free, starts from 0 knowledge, and could even be used as the very first resource, instead of e.g. LYAH.\\n2. [The Simple Haskell Handbook](https://marcosampellegrini.com/simple-haskell-book) -> not free, expects you to know the basics of Haskell already\\n\\nOnce you have more experience with projects, I would recommend re-reading your beginner book of choice. This time, you can skip the parts you already know and focus on what was confusing before. You will likely have a much easier time grasping those harder concepts.\\n\\np.s. If you are looking for a bit of extra motivation, check the blog post my teammate Shayne recently wrote about [his journey with Haskell](https://wasp-lang.dev/blog/2022/08/26/how-and-why-i-got-started-with-haskell). He started in late 2021 and has already made huge progress!\\n\\n---\\n\\n*Good luck with Haskell!

I\u2019ve also tried some obscure ones, albeit less frequently and for different purposes: MIPS assembly language and OCaml for academic work (I\u2019m a BS, MS, and PhD dropout in CS), and Zig for some side projects. In short, I like learning new languages (at least at a surface level) and have been exposed to different programming paradigms, including functional.\\n\\nYet, I have never done Haskell. I\u2019ve wanted to learn it since my college days, but never got the time. In late 2021, though, my curiosity took over. I wanted to see for myself if the mystique and the Kool-Aid hype (or hate) around it are justified. :P So, I decided I\u2019d start learning it on the side and also look for a company that uses it as my next gig. That\u2019s how my Haskell journey started, and [how I got into Wasp](https://wasp-lang.dev/blog/2021/12/21/shayne-intro) a few months later.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Why learn Haskell?\\n\\nHaskell seems to have an aura of superiority around it. Many niche and heavily academically-inspired languages do. These languages seem to be used by the enlightened minds and allow you to quickly write complex programs in a fraction of the time with significantly less code. Lisp is amongst these languages, too. Yet, nobody uses them for anything real \u2014 only toy projects. (While stroking their long, grey beards under a tree, ruminating on the philosophy of computer science.) At least, that\u2019s the impression I got in college and at work. So, what makes Haskell interesting to learn, let alone want to use professionally?\\n\\n**First, it is functional as it gets.** While I have used lambdas and functional concepts like `map` in non-functional languages, the fact that these were my *only* choice was really interesting to me. After years of extensive OO usage, I\u2019ve come to appreciate this epigram by Alan Perlis. I think it captures a mindset shift between the two paradigms:\\n\\n> \u201cIt is better to have 100 functions operate on one data structure than 10 functions on 10 data structures.\u201d \u2014 Alan Perlis\\n>\\n\\nIn OO, you create lots of classes with lots of methods. In functional, you have far fewer data structures (mostly list) with a lot more functions. So basically more functions to operate on fewer nouns, whereas OO is lots of nouns, each with many bespoke methods. (The first comment on [this Stack Overflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6016271/why-is-it-better-to-have-100-functions-operate-on-one-data-structure-than-10-fun) explains it really well.)\\n\\nBesides, I liked the idea of referential transparency when writing pure functions. It means that you get the same result back every time you invoke a function, without fear of unknown side effects. (But the language does offer the flexibility to have side effects like IO, via Monads.) I also liked having only immutable data structures \u2014 they make reasoning about the system and data flow easier. There were many things like these two that I liked. The point is that thinking functionally really changes the way you structure and solve problems, so I was curious to give it a go.\\n\\n**Second, Haskell is lazy.** While there are pros and cons to this, it feels undeniably different. Most languages are strict, in that all function arguments are evaluated before invoking a function. This is required because of side effects; to have some expectations regarding the order in which things will run. Haskell does the opposite: it delays evaluation until it\u2019s actually needed.\\n\\nOne contrived yet helpful example of laziness is infinite data structures. Below, we define `fibs` as an infinite `List` of `Integer` values, by using references to *itself*! (You can find a runnable example [here](https://replit.com/@ShayneCzyzewsk1/LazyHaskellExample?v=1#Main.hs).) \\n\\n```haskell\\nfibs :: [Integer]\\nfibs = 0 : 1 : zipWith (+) fibs (tail fibs)\\n\\ntake 10 fibs -- [0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34]\\n```\\n\\nThere\u2019s a downside to laziness, too. It makes it harder to reason about performance and resource utilization. But the idea that you can define things in a declarative way but know that they are evaluated only when needed is a pretty eye-opening way to program.\\n\\nTo sum up: Haskell is functional, lazy, and strongly statically typed. Just the trifecta that gets me out of bed in the morning! :D So, how did I go about learning it?\\n\\n## Hello Haskell!\\n\\nI started by reading the canonical Haskell newbie resource, \u201c*[Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!](http://learnyouahaskell.com/),*\u201d often abbreviated LYAH. It was very entertaining, and I learned a lot from it. At times, I wanted it to get to the point more quickly. Still, despite the amusing images and often lengthy examples, it provided me with a great conceptual foundation. I highly recommend it as your first read \u2014 it is a really well-written resource for beginners.\\n\\nAfter I was about 80% done with LYAH, I switched to a more recent but still popular book: \u201c*[Haskell Programming from First Principles](https://haskellbook.com/)*.\u201d I liked that it started with fundamentals and then moved to more complex topics, slowly but steadily developing my understanding. It was pretty long, though, and sometimes went too far into the weeds. It also had a tinge of intellectual flexing at certain points. Still, it was a good read. I\u2019d read it again if I were starting over.\\n\\nI also tried [a Haskell course from Google](https://github.com/google/haskell-trainings). Despite being brief, it explains the key concepts in a relatively complete way. If videos are your thing, it might be a solid way to get up to speed.\\n\\nIn short, skimming an intro book to get your foundation solid would be the best bet. I\u2019d also recommend trying out many different online resources when covering more intermediate topics, like Monad Transformers, for example. And don\u2019t worry if it takes a while to start feeling comfortable with things that are pretty specific to Haskell! It just takes some time, and often it is more confusing to derive/deeply understand than to just start using them at first. The understanding will come over time. (Of course, sometimes [pictures](https://adit.io/posts/2013-04-17-functors,_applicatives,_and_monads_in_pictures.html) help!)\\n\\n## Setup and IDE support\\n\\nGetting Haskell up and running was surprisingly straightforward, even though I ran it on an M1 MacBook Air, which was considered a pretty new architecture in 2021. Since the entire toolchain was not fully ARM-compatible back then, some of the setup advice required a bit of modification. But that was no big deal: I used `ghcup`, installed HLS in VS Code, and bam! \u2014 I had Haskell up and running. It was a pretty nice experience. \\n\\nSome minor downsides I recall:\\n\\n- There doesn\u2019t seem to be a consensus on which build and package management tool to use, Cabal or Stack. However, unless you\u2019re doing something super specific, it\u2019s not an irreversible decision. At Wasp, we started with Stack but then migrated to Cabal since it better fit our setup and workflows. It was pretty seamless.\\n- One thing I do miss from other IDEs is breakpoint debugging. Technically, there\u2019s *some* support for it in Haskell, but I don\u2019t think many use it. Breakpoints and lazy evaluation don\u2019t seem to be BFFs.\\n\\n## 0-60 at work\\n\\nFor someone with experience in several different languages, it is pretty achievable to be able to solve minor bugs/features in Haskell after a few weeks of learning. At least, it was for me. I certainly struggled on best practices and such, and my code reviews involved some Haskell golfing comments for sure :) But I could make it do what I wanted it to do from the functionality perspective. Kudos to the mostly helpful compiler errors (with a bit of practice reading) and the Internet!\\n\\nHopefully, your code base demonstrates established project and Haskell patterns, so you can learn as you poke around, and your early code reviewers are supportive coworkers who can explain things as part of their suggestions. I was quite fortunate in that regard: the Wasp team values teaching and learning, and the codebase uses what is called \u201cSimple Haskell\u201d, which limits the use of excessive language extensions in the hopes to keep the core language and concepts as tight as possible. (Note: there are Haskell experts who view this as a severe limitation of the capabilities of the language, but as a newbie, I was happy they did it.)\\n\\n## So, was the juice worth the squeeze?\\n\\nLearning Haskell took considerable time and effort. It was completely different from any language I had used before. Yet, I am very happy I embarked on this journey. Even if you do not intend to get a job using Haskell, I still think learning it is worthwhile just to expand your programming point of view and master functional concepts. And for a select set of project types (like writing a compiler for a full-stack web DSL), I feel it really will make you more productive over time. Give an intro to Haskell tutorial or video a try some weekend and let me know what you think!

Well\u2026\\n\\nSome people think that\u2019s because most startups aren\u2019t worth joining. I disagree. This argument generalizes one\u2019s own reasons for joining a startup onto every other human being out there, which is unlikely to be true. I think most startups, no matter how ordinary, *do* have a reason to join them; *a good reason*; even *many good reasons* \u2014 they just fail to communicate them well. They\u2019re like a shy nerd on Tinder with an empty bio and no profile pic: a kind, intelligent, and thoughtful human being who, unfortunately, will be ruthlessly swiped left \u2014 not because he\u2019s a bad match but because his profile doesn\u2019t show why he\u2019s a good one.\\n\\nVisually, this \u201cTinder profile problem\u201d looks like this:\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"Illustration of candidates not seeing why to join a startup\\"\\n    source=\\"img/worth-joining/illustration-1-min.png\\"\\n    caption=\\"\\"\\n/>\\n\\nNow, look what would happen if a startup communicated a bit better. Suddenly, our candidates could see a reason to join. If the reason is good, they might even swipe right.\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"Illustration of candidates seeing one reason to join a startup\\"\\n    source=\\"img/worth-joining/illustration-2-min.png\\"\\n    caption=\\"\\"\\n/>\\n\\nBut most startups have *many* good reasons to join them. If only they communicated well, the outcome would be something like this:\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"Illustration of candidates seeing many reasons to join; one candidate already running for it\\"\\n    source=\\"img/worth-joining/illustration-3-min.png\\"\\n    caption=\\"\\"\\n/>\\n\\nNow, you\u2019re probably wondering just what exactly those reasons are.\\n\\nHere\u2019s a rough list:\\n\\n1. The founders are interesting / fun / smart / human / you name it\\n2. The team is great\\n3. The culture is amazing\\n4. The business is doing well\\n\\nHowever, if you just copy this list and paste it on your jobs page, you will accomplish nothing. The candidates will never believe you. What you need to do instead is to *supply them with a system of concretes (facts) from which their minds will form these abstract conclusions.*\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\n- Instead of declaring that \u201cthe founders are reflective, thoughtful, and persistent,\u201d show them how so, like Sarah from Canny does by writing comprehensive year-in-review blog posts for [four years in a row](https://canny.io/blog/year-four-in-review/).\\n- Instead of proclaiming that \u201cthe founders are humble and can have fun,\u201d show them how so, like Michael from Fibery did by becoming a hero of [this hilarious page](https://fibery.io/remote). (No businessy founder would ever agree to make this public. Michael did.)\\n- Instead of purporting that \u201cthe team is great\u201d or \u201cyou\u2019ll work alongside very smart people\u201d (God, I hate that one!), show them who exactly those people are, as PostHog does [here](https://posthog.com/handbook/company/team) and Wasp does [here](https://wasp-lang.dev/blog/2021/12/21/shayne-intro) and [here](https://wasp-lang.dev/blog/2022/05/31/filip-intro).\\n\\nIn the rest of the post, I\u2019ll go through the four broad reasons to join a startup one by one and show real-life examples of communicating them well. In the end, I will explain how these four reasons, communicated well, fuse into two compelling messages that will interest any candidate.\\n\\nOne last thing. For the sake of clarity and comprehension, I will write in the second person. Instead of saying \u201ccandidates would never believe them,\u201d I will say \u201cyou would never believe them.\u201d It\u2019s much easier to read and understand.\\n\\n## **Possible reasons why your startup is worth joining, and how to communicate them well**\\n\\n### **1. FOUNDERS \u2014 or, the founders are interesting / fun / smart / human / you name it**\\n\\nMost startups have curious, interesting, ambitious, terribly smart founders; the kind most of us would love to work for if we had a chance. Sadly, only a few leverage this asset. In most cases, all you get is a small round pic with a fancy title and a few abstract, high-level sentences that cause no excitement whatsoever. What a shame!\\n\\n#### **How Canny commmunicates who their founders are**\\n\\n##### **Founder Stories blog category**\\n\\nThe first notable thing Canny does is the [Founder Stories category](https://canny.io/blog/founder-stories/) in their blog. By quickly skimming the posts, you can understand that Sarah and Andrew (the founders):\\n\\n- Accept their mistakes, talk about them, and learn from them. Even if the issue is sensitive, like firing people. ([Reflections from the last 2 years as a founder](https://canny.io/blog/reflections-two-year-founder/), [First hire to first fire](https://canny.io/blog/hire-fire/).)\\n- Are reflective, thoughtful, and persistent people. ([How we built a $1m ARR SaaS startup](https://canny.io/blog/how-we-built-a-1m-arr-saas-startup/), [Year four in review: Overcoming the unexpected](https://canny.io/blog/year-four-in-review/).)\\n- Have very definite, clear values. But, more importantly, stand up to them, even if that means losing revenue. ([Saying no to big customers](https://canny.io/blog/saying-no-big-customers/).)\\n\\nIf they just pinned this list of virtues to their Jobs page, you would never believe them. Instead, Sarah and Andrew show what actions they take, how they work, how they think, *how they live* \u2014 and you make up their own mind about what kind of people Sarah and Andrew are from seeing all that. The difference is enormous.\\n\\nNote their writing style. They don\u2019t claim to be know-it-alls with titles like \u201cHow *to* bootstrap your startup.\u201d Instead, they write \u201cHow *we* Bootstrapped *our* SaaS Startup to Ramen Profitability.\u201d They cover only what they know instead of overgeneralizing. This shows both expertise and humility.\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"A screenshot of Canny\'s Founder Stories blog category\\"\\n    source=\\"img/worth-joining/canny-founder-stories-min.png\\"\\n    caption=\\"\\"\\n/>\\n\\n##### **Personal Instagram**\\n\\nThe second thing Sarah and Andrew do well to communicate who they are is their [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/carryoncode/). They don\u2019t post glamorous keynote appearances, as many entrepreneurs do. They share the actual day-to-day working life \u2014 both the fun and the struggle. It gives you a good idea of what they\u2019re after in life. (Not keynotes.) That\u2019s why it works, and that\u2019s why people love it.\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"A photo from Sarah and Andrew\'s personal Instagram\\"\\n    source=\\"img/worth-joining/canny-instagram-min.png\\"\\n    caption=\\"\\"\\n/>\\n\\n*Side note: Sarah explains how she develops the Canny brand in [this post](https://canny.io/blog/building-your-brand-with-storytelling/). If you want to build a good one, give it a read. She also wrote about how they attract top talent. You can read it [here](https://canny.io/blog/startup-attract-top-talent/).*\\n\\n#### **How Fibery communicates who their founder is**\\n\\n##### **Startup Diary blog post series**\\n\\nWhile you can get a pretty good idea of Michael (the founder) from the hilarious \u201c[Remote](https://fibery.io/remote)\u201d page Fibery shipped last year, his [Startup Diary post series](https://fibery.io/blog/startup-diary) offers an even better insight into his soul. In these monthly posts, Michael honestly shares everything that\u2019s going on with Fibery, including the good, the bad, and the ugly: firing people for poor performance, losing important customers, and failing to reach product-market fit. The fact that he\u2019s already written 45 of those (as of Aug 2022) is also telling. And he\u2019s not a native English speaker. If he can do that, why can\u2019t you?\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"A screenshot of Fibery\'s Startup Diary blog category\\"\\n    source=\\"img/worth-joining/fibery-startup-diary-min.png\\"\\n    caption=\\"\\"\\n/>\\n\\n##### **Crazy challenges**\\n\\nBesides writing the Startup Diary, Michael also embarks on crazy challenges like [writing 100 posts about products](https://fibery.io/blog/100-posts-about-products). Only a passionate, driven person would commit to such a thing. You cannot help but respect him for it. (Before this challenge, he wrote 100 Medium posts in 100 days in 2018. You can read them [here](https://mdubakov.medium.com/). Just scroll a few screens to reach the old stuff.)\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"A screenshot of Fibery\'s 100 posts about products blog category\\"\\n    source=\\"img/worth-joining/fibery-challenges-min.png\\"\\n    caption=\\"\\"\\n/>\\n\\nIf you look carefully, you\u2019ll notice that Michael\u2019s thinking about building a company is different from Sarah\u2019s. For example, he despises the gentle, soothing \u201cOh don\u2019t worry that it didn\u2019t work out; you did such a good work!\u201d approach, which is ubiquitous in the modern startup world. Instead, he states that [dissatisfaction leads to progress](https://fibery.io/blog/dissatisfaction-leads-to-progress/), referring to the famous [\u201cNot quite my tempo\u201d](https://youtu.be/xDAsABdkWSc) scene from Whiplash. Does that make you like him more than Sarah?\\n\\nIt depends. If you believe that being soft and balanced is better, you\u2019ll go with Sarah; if you believe that real progress comes only from working yourself to the bone, you\u2019ll go with Michael (or Elon). The important thing is that both founders have their own, unique viewpoints of how things should be done, and that they communicate these viewpoints as-is instead of chopping their legs off to fit the latest Procrustean fad.\\n\\n##### **In-depth, original blog posts about the industry**\\n\\nSome entrepreneurs say that doing a startup is like \u201cjumping off a cliff and building your wings on the way down.\u201d Some of it might be true. But if you want *reasonable* people to jump with you, you better tell them that you have a degree in engineering and know how to assemble wings in a free fall. Otherwise, the only team you\u2019ll recruit is a suicide squad looking for a splashy hit.\\n\\nTo communicate his expertise, Michael writes in-depth, original, theoretical posts about the nature of knowledge management and organizational productivity. These posts are gems, both literally and metaphorically. (They\u2019re filed under the [Gems category](https://fibery.io/blog/gems) in the [Fibery blog](https://fibery.io/blog/).)\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\n- [Fibery.io Vision v.1: Getting Started](https://fibery.io/blog/fibery-vision-v1/)\\n- [The Next Wave of Work Management Software](https://fibery.io/blog/the-next-wave-of-work-management-software/)\\n- [Augmenting Organizational Intelligence](https://fibery.io/blog/augmenting-organizational-intelligence/)\\n- [Use Networks to Prioritize Product Features](https://fibery.io/blog/use-networks-to-prioritize-product-features/)\\n\\nAfter reading these articles, you understand not only that Michael really knows how to build wings while falling off the cliff, but that he has already jumped a few times. (Prior to Fibery, Michael had worked on knowledge management for more than a decade. He also had built a successful project management software, [Targetprocess](https://www.apptio.com/products/targetprocess/).) You know that he\u2019s an expert who can be trusted.\\n\\nInterestingly, even though Michael writes differently from Sarah, they both leverage what they\u2019re good at. Sarah does not try to produce treatises on software development philosophy, and Michael doesn\u2019t gush out with his personal learnings from building a startup. That, I think, is the right way to do it.\\n\\n#### **How PostHog communicates who their founders are**\\n\\nPostHog\u2019s founders James and Tim don\u2019t write 100 posts in 100 days or run a personal Instagram. But they\u2019ve come up with something else to communicate what kind of people they are. And it\u2019s something unique.\\n\\n##### **Well-written, concise bio**\\n\\nFirst, both founders have decent [profiles](https://posthog.com/handbook/company/team) in the company handbook. These bios are short, clear, and humane. They\u2019re also very specific. Where else have you seen the name of the CEO\u2019s cat?\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"A screenshot of James Hawkins\' bio in the PostHog Handbook\\"\\n    source=\\"img/worth-joining/posthog-james-bio-min.png\\"\\n    caption=\\"\\"\\n/>\\n\\n##### **Personal README files**\\n\\nSecond, both James and Tim have an extensive README file ([one](https://posthog.com/handbook/company/team/james-hawkins), [two](https://posthog.com/handbook/company/team/tim-glaser)) on how to work with them. These files give you an insight into their productivity habits, interests, and quirks. In fact, after reading them, you will likely have a better idea of the founders than you\u2019d usually get from working at a company for a month!\\n\\nFor instance, James\u2019s file has sections like:\\n\\n- **Short bio.** Includes very specific details like: \u201cI tend to work 9am to 5pm with an hour for lunch, then I have a gap to have dinner with my family, then 9pm to around 11pm ish.\u201d\\n- ***Very clear* areas of responsibility.** No need to wonder what the hell the CEO is doing anymore!\\n- **Quirks.** These are remarkably humble and open-minded, like:\\n    - \u201cIf I haven\u2019t responded to something that you\u2019ve sent me, that\u2019s probably because I\u2019ve read it and don\u2019t feel particularly strongly - so just make a call on what to do if you don\u2019t hear back in a reasonable time frame.\u201d\\n    - \u201cI\u2019m a little disorganized. I compensate for this by making sure the teams I work on have this skill. Often I think this actually helps me prioritize the things that really matter.\u201d\\n    - Explaining these quirks is an ingenious move. Besides explaining how to work with James, this section communicates that he\u2019s profoundly self-aware and willing to accept and leverage his weaknesses. These qualities are very rare and incredibly valuable.\\n- **What I value.** In stark contrast to most HR nonsense, these values are very clear, very specific, and written in English rather than HRese. (I just came up with this term: it means \u201clegalese but for HR.\u201d) Here are two examples:\\n    - \u201cProactivity. Do not ask me for permission to do things - I wouldn\u2019t have hired you if I didn\u2019t trust you. I\u2019d rather 9 things get done well and 1 thing I disagree with than we don\u2019t get anything done at all.\u201d\\n    - \u201cDirectness impresses me. If you don\u2019t like something please just say so. It makes for much healthier relationships.\u201d\\n\\nIn addition to that, there\u2019s also: How I can help you, How you can help me, My goals until end December 2022 (very specific!), Personal strategy, Execution todo (including \u201c1 bike ride a week\u201d!) and Archived todo.\\n\\nIn summary, this README page is a gem. I wish more founders had them.\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"A screenshot of James Hawkins\' README in the PostHog Handbook\\"\\n    source=\\"img/worth-joining/posthog-james-readme-min.png\\"\\n    caption=\\"\\"\\n/>\\n\\n#### **How we at Wasp communicate who our founders are**\\n\\n##### **\u201cWho we are\u201d section of every job description page**\\n\\nMatija and Martin (the founders of Wasp) embedded a concise description of who they are right into each [job description page](https://www.notion.so/402274568afa4d7eb7f428f8fa2c0816) in Notion. They knew that this is the first company artifact many candidates will see. So they saved candidates time and effort on digging up who the hell started Wasp.\\n\\nNote the language and substance of this list. When you read it, you immediately get a sense of who Matija and Martin are as people \u2014 fun, easygoing, no-corporate-bullshit kinda guys. Now imagine it said something \u201cmore normal,\u201d like: \u201cThe company was founded by seasoned entrepreneurs\u2026\u201d What impression would that make?\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"A screenshot of Wasp\'s job description page\\"\\n    source=\\"img/worth-joining/wasp-who-we-are-min.png\\"\\n    caption=\\"\\"\\n/>\\n\\n### **2. TEAM \u2014 or, the team is great**\\n\\nIt is startling how little most startups tell you about their teams. Often all you get is a chessboard of faces and titles, which gives you no idea who these people are *as people* or how working with them will feel like*.* Given how crucial a reason \u201cgreat team\u201d is for most candidates, improving how you communicate it seems like a low-hanging fruit.\\n\\n#### **How Canny communicates who is on their team**\\n\\n##### **Decent team page**\\n\\nThe Canny\u2019s difference starts with a team page. It has a dense summary of who each team member is as a person and includes high-quality, lively photos of everybody.\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"A screenshot of Canny\'s Team page\\"\\n    source=\\"img/worth-joining/canny-team-bios-min.png\\"\\n    caption=\\"\\"\\n/>\\n\\nLook how specific those bios are. In most cases, all you get here is a generic \u201cdeveloper\u201d or \u201cmarketer\u201d without any personal details. Bios of robots, not people. No wonder nothing comes to mind, except perhaps for Agent Smith. But Canny\u2019s bios are different. When you read them, you can actually imagine the person! They\u2019re Neos in the world of Smiths.\\n\\n##### **Remarkable \u201cWhy work at Canny\u201d blog post**\\n\\nFrom there, it gets only better. Canny\u2019s chief weapon for explaining their team is a blog post, the \u201c[Why work at Canny](https://canny.io/blog/work-at-canny/)\u201d blog post. Sarah wrote it back in the summer of 2021. It is full of quotes from team members and photos of their workdays and vacations. *Real photos of real people*. No wonder the comments section under the post abounds with raving fans willing to join the team straight away!\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"A screenshot of comments under the Canny\'s Why work at Canny blog post\\"\\n    source=\\"img/worth-joining/canny-why-work-post-comments-min.png\\"\\n    caption=\\"\\"\\n/>\\n\\nPerhaps the best thing about this post is how little work it takes to create one. I imagine that collecting the data took some time, but the actual writing (it\u2019s an 11-min read) took no more than a week. A week of work for a candidate magnet of such tremendous power? Sounds like a deal.\\n\\n*P.s. Sarah writes a lot more about their team in her yearly review posts, but I decided not to elaborate on those for the sake of clarity. You can check them out here: [year 1](https://canny.io/blog/lessons-learned-bootstrapping-saas/), [year 2](https://canny.io/blog/year-two-lessons-bootstrapping/), [year 3](https://canny.io/blog/year-three-lessons-bootstrapped-startup/), and [year 4](https://canny.io/blog/year-four-in-review/).*\\n\\n#### **How Fibery communicates who is on their team**\\n\\n##### **Weird About Us page**\\n\\nUnlike Canny and PostHog\u2019s, Fibery\u2019s [About Us](https://fibery.io/about-us) page doesn\u2019t reveal much info about each team member. You will find no bios or README files there. But it clearly tells you one thing: the team is a bunch of weirdos. So, if weird is your thing, you\u2019ll be attracted to Fibery like a moth to a flame. (Side note: Fibery managed to clearly explain their vision in one paragraph. This is rare.)\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"A screenshot of Fibery\'s About Us page\\"\\n    source=\\"img/worth-joining/fibery-about-us-min.png\\"\\n    caption=\\"\\"\\n/>\\n\\n##### **Team-related parts of Startup Diary**\\n\\nI\u2019ve already mentioned Michael\u2019s [Startup Diary](https://fibery.io/blog/startup-diary) monthly blog series. What I didn\u2019t say is that each post communicates something about the team: who did what that month, random Slack posts (links, quotes, tweets, and images), etc. If someone new joined that month, Michael writes a few paragraphs explaining who that person is, where they come from, what they\u2019re going to do at Fibery, and even attaches a photo. Like [Chris](https://fibery.io/blog/chronicles-36/).\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"A screenshot of Fibery\'s Startup Diary blog post\\"\\n    source=\\"img/worth-joining/fibery-chris-min.png\\"\\n    caption=\\"\\"\\n/>\\n\\n#### **How PostHog communicates who is on their team**\\n\\n##### **Team section in the company handbook**\\n\\nAt PostHog, every team member has a well-written, few-paragraphs-long bio and a stylish illustration on the [Team section](https://posthog.com/handbook/company/team) of the [PostHog\u2019s Handbook](https://posthog.com/handbook/). (Which is a work of art worthy of its own blog post, by the way.) Many team members have their own README files, like the founders do. Check out Lottie Coxon\u2019s, PostHog\u2019s Graphic Designer\u2019s README [here](https://posthog.com/handbook/company/team/lottie-coxon), and some others [here](https://posthog.com/handbook/company/team/yakko-majuri) and [here](https://posthog.com/handbook/company/team/karl-aksel-puulmann). Even a quick read through these bios and READMEs gives you a good idea of who PostHog has on board.\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"A screenshot of PostHog\'s team section in the handbook\\"\\n    source=\\"img/worth-joining/posthog-team-1-min.png\\"\\n    caption=\\"\\"\\n/>\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"Another screenshot of PostHog\'s team section in the handbook\\"\\n    source=\\"img/worth-joining/posthog-team-2-min.png\\"\\n    caption=\\"\\"\\n/>\\n\\n##### **Day-in-life videos from employees**\\n\\nIn addition to bios and READMEs, PostHog has [a day-in-life video](https://youtu.be/xlODCLrZyvM) of Lottie, their graphic designer. It communicates a lot more information about what kind of person she is and how working at PostHog feels like than her bio. I wish they had more of those.\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"A screenshot from PostHog\'s graphic designer day-in-life video\\"\\n    source=\\"img/worth-joining/posthog-lottie-video-min.png\\"\\n    caption=\\"\\"\\n/>\\n\\nFinally, PostHog\u2019s handbook offers two more sections where candidates can learn even more about the team: [Culture](https://posthog.com/handbook/company/culture) and [Team structure](https://posthog.com/handbook/people/team-structure/team-structure#reporting-structure). All are worth a read, and each tells you something new about the company and the team, nurturing your liking and respect for these people. Definitely worth stealing.\\n\\n#### **How we at Wasp communicate who is on our team**\\n\\n##### **\u201cMeet the team\u201d blog posts**\\n\\nTo help candidates understand who they will be working with, we at Wasp write a blog post about each new hire:\\n\\n- [Meet the team - Filip Sodi\u0107, Founding Engineer](https://wasp-lang.dev/blog/2022/05/31/filip-intro)\\n- [Meet the team - Shayne Czyzewski, Founding Engineer](https://wasp-lang.dev/blog/2021/12/21/shayne-intro)\\n\\nThe posts are brief enough to be read in one sitting. Yet, they are very informative. Basically, each post is an interview, presented as an article. We hope they give candidates a good idea of who they\'ll be spending half of their waking time with.\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"A screenshot of Wasp\'s Meet the team blog post\\"\\n    source=\\"img/worth-joining/wasp-meet-the-team-min.png\\"\\n    caption=\\"\\"\\n/>\\n\\n### **3. CULTURE \u2014 or, the culture is amazing**\\n\\nWhile researchers still argue about the ultimate definition, most of us understand culture as \u201cwhat working here feels like\u201d and/or \u201chow we do things here.\u201d We also understand how crucial it is for those looking for work. It seems glaringly obvious that startups should work hard on communicating their culture. Yet, most companies don\u2019t. Or, even worse, they flood their websites with meaningless HR fluff, which only scares interesting people away. In short, communicating culture well is another low-hanging fruit waiting to be picked.\\n\\n#### **How Canny communicates their culture**\\n\\nCanny does an outstanding job at communicating their culture. The primary tool they employ is, once again, their [blog](https://canny.io/blog/founder-stories/). (Note how multifunctional it is: founders, expertise, team, and now culture.) The posts in the Founder Stories category convey very well what working at Canny feels like. Here are a few examples.\\n\\n##### **\u201cWhy work at Canny\u201d blog post**\\n\\nI\u2019ll risk repeating myself, but [this post](https://canny.io/blog/work-at-canny/) so beautifully explains Canny\u2019s culture that I couldn\u2019t resist. It mentions why and how they work remotely, how they do team retreats (with photos and a [video](https://youtu.be/u4yOS1cuMSQ) from Lisbon!), and how they had fun together playing weird Zoom games when travel was not an option due to Covid.\\n\\nPay attention to the imagery. It communicates a lot more information than any lengthy, elaborate description would. Indeed, a picture is often worth a thousand words.\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"A photo of Canny\'s two team members hacking in Denver\\"\\n    source=\\"img/worth-joining/canny-hacking-in-denver-min.jpeg\\"\\n    caption=\\"\\"\\n/>\\n\\n##### **\u201cLessons from a year of team retreats\u201d blog post**\\n\\nInstead of saying that \u201cteam is our priority\u201d or \u201cwe invest in our people,\u201d Sarah [shows](https://canny.io/blog/lessons-from-team-retreats/) what they\u2019ve done to support their team. \\n\\nAgain, note how specific the imagery is.\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"A photo from Canny\'s Lessons from a year of team retreats blog post\\"\\n    source=\\"img/worth-joining/canny-year-of-retreats-min.jpeg\\"\\n    caption=\\"\\"\\n/>\\n\\nInterestingly, Sarah\u2019s post isn\u2019t framed as \u201chey we do many team retreats, we\u2019re awesome, come work for us.\u201d If they wrote that, the reader would feel uneasy. They would sense bragging. That\u2019s why the explicit message in the post is what Canny learned doing team retreats, not that they\u2019ve done many. This explicit message, however, *implies* that they indeed have done many retreats! It sends a message that Canny cares for their employees without explicitly saying so. This is what true mastery looks like.\\n\\n##### **\u201cThe end of our digital nomad journey\u201d blog post**\\n\\nAlthough [this post](https://canny.io/blog/end-digital-nomad-journey/) describes Sarah and Andrew\u2019s personal nomad experience, Sarah managed to reveal Canny\u2019s culture through it. To do that, she described how the team worked on Canny during those nomad years. She also wrote about their communication struggles, routines, and a lot more. And, again, look at how effectively her seemingly imperfect screenshots and photos transmit the vibe!\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"A photo from Canny\'s The end of our digital nomad journey blog post\\"\\n    source=\\"img/worth-joining/canny-end-of-nomad-min.jpeg\\"\\n    caption=\\"\\"\\n/>\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"Another photo from Canny\'s The end of our digital nomad journey blog post\\"\\n    source=\\"img/worth-joining/canny-end-of-nomad-2-min.jpeg\\"\\n    caption=\\"\\"\\n/>\\n\\n#### **How Fibery communicates their culture**\\n\\nWhile Fibery\u2019s culture is different from Canny\u2019s, they also communicate it well. Their primary tool is a weird, quirky [website](https://fibery.io/) full of special projects that give you a sense of how they do things at Fibery and what working there feels like.\\n\\n##### **Anxiety page**\\n\\nThe first project is Fibery\u2019s [/anxiety page](https://fibery.io/anxiety). Launched in 2019, it mocks every serious enterprise software out there with puns like \u201cYet another collaboration tool\u201d as the page title, \u201cMistake\u201d as a sign-up button text, and, my favorite, \u201cTry\u2014Suffer\u2014Quit\u201d page structure.\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"A screenshot of Fibery\'s /anxiety page\\"\\n    source=\\"img/worth-joining/fibery-anxiety-min.png\\"\\n    caption=\\"\\"\\n/>\\n\\nOne day three years ago, someone [submitted](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21643683) this page to Hacker News. The post surged to the top of the frontpage, stayed there for many hours, and got 705 upvotes and 145 comments from people all over the world relating to Fibery\u2019s culture. Why? Because it felt real.\\n\\nHere\u2019s a glimpse of what people wrote in the comments:\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"A screenshot of Hacker News comments on Fibery\'s /anxiety page\\"\\n    source=\\"img/worth-joining/fibery-hn-1-min.png\\"\\n    caption=\\"\\"\\n/>\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"Another screenshot of Hacker News comments on Fibery\'s /anxiety page\\"\\n    source=\\"img/worth-joining/fibery-hn-2-min.png\\"\\n    caption=\\"\\"\\n/>\\n\\n##### **Remote page**\\n\\nThe second special project Fibery did to communicate their culture is the [/remote page](https://fibery.io/remote). It shows what working from home is *really* like. It\u2019s the funniest thing I\u2019ve ever seen done by a software startup. (Have you ever seen a CEO being licked by a dog?) It also shows how the Fibery team works and even how they use Fibery to build Fibery. Like Canny\u2019s \u201cLessons from a year of team retreats\u201d blog post, it does so implicitly. A true masterpiece.\\n\\n##### **Weird, humorous site**\\n\\nBroadly, the whole [site](https://fibery.io/) screams that Fibery is a place for misfits, rebels, and trouble makers; the place where such people will be valued and will feel like home; the place built around brutal honesty and spicy humor.\\n\\nThe \u201cWhat (non-)customers say\u201d section is worth a mention. Over my nine years in startups, I haven\u2019t seen a site that a) lists *bad* customer reviews; and b) uses \ud83d\udca9 emoji as a filter. Again, this is telling. It says a lot about who they are as people: humble, real, and fond of humor.\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"A screenshot of Fibery\'s About Us page, What non-customers say section\\"\\n    source=\\"img/worth-joining/fibery-what-customers-say-min.png\\"\\n    caption=\\"\\"\\n/>\\n\\n#### **How PostHog communicates their culture**\\n\\n##### **Comprehensive company handbook covering all-things culture**\\n\\nPostHog\u2019s way of communicating their culture is the most explicit of all four examples, yet very effective. Their primary tool is the [PostHog Handbook](https://posthog.com/handbook), which covers virtually *every* aspect of what working at PostHog feels like: interviews, onboarding, training, management, communication, and even firing. (They call it [offboarding](https://posthog.com/handbook/people/offboarding).)\\n\\nThe handbook goes all the way up to the [high-level strategy](https://posthog.com/handbook/strategy/strategy), which is very clear. Notably, PostHog\u2019s strategy section not only puts forth ambitious goals but actually explains how exactly the company will get there.\\n\\n[The values section](https://posthog.com/handbook/company/values) is *very* specific; perhaps the most specific I\u2019ve ever seen. PostHog does not merely list their values as meaningless abstractions but supports them with evidence. Some values have many paragraphs of examples demonstrating how the team follows them.\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"A screenshot of the Values section in the PostHog\'s handbook\\"\\n    source=\\"img/worth-joining/posthog-values-min.png\\"\\n    caption=\\"\\"\\n/>\\n\\nThey also have a specific [Culture page](https://posthog.com/handbook/company/culture) with [a 5-minute video from the CEO](https://youtu.be/rRwzJiljpSA) explaining how they designed PostHog for remote work from day one, which nicely complements the text.\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"A screenshot from James Hawkins\'s video\\"\\n    source=\\"img/worth-joining/posthog-james-video-min.png\\"\\n    caption=\\"\\"\\n/>\\n\\nIn summary, if Canny\u2019s weapon of choice is the blog and Fibery\u2019s is the website, then PostHog\u2019s is definitely the handbook. It\u2019s a work of art.\\n\\n#### **How we at Wasp communicate our culture**\\n\\n##### **Easygoing vibe from memes, copy, and imagery**\\n\\nUnlike Posthog, we at Wasp don\u2019t (yet) have a dedicated Culture page. We are too small for that. But that doesn\u2019t stop us from showing what working at Wasp feels like. We just use different tools.\\n\\nOur [Twitter](https://twitter.com/WaspLang), [blog](https://wasp-lang.dev/blog), and [monthly updates](https://us4.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=8139c7de74df98aa17054b235&id=f0c6ba5f1d) abound with memes, GIFs, and hilarious imagery. Plus, we write them in a humorous, lighthearted, easygoing style. By just scrolling through these things for a few minutes, candidates can understand that we aren\u2019t some corporate bros. And if they like working on interesting things *while having fun*, they won\u2019t help but feel an inkling to reach out.\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"A funny image from Wasp\'s blog post about GitHub Copilot\\"\\n    source=\\"img/worth-joining/wasp-vibe-blog-min.png\\"\\n    caption=\\"\\"\\n/>\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"A photo of Wasp\'s team packing t-shirts for users\\"\\n    source=\\"img/worth-joining/wasp-vibe-tshirts-min.jpeg\\"\\n    caption=\\"\\"\\n/>\\n\\n### **4. PROGRESS \u2014 or, the business is doing well**\\n\\nWhen you just closed an $80 million Series B or signed Facebook as a customer, communicating progress is easy. You just state these facts. However, most companies need to attract great people way before Series B. In fact, it is these very people who\u2019re going to get you there. As most startups are secretive about how things are going, communicating that things are going *somehow* \u2014 no matter how negligible your progress in contrast to the big guys \u2014 becomes quite an advantage. It immediately de-risks the opportunity in the candidate\u2019s eyes. So, if EXPERTISE is about convincing candidates that you know how to build the wings, PROGRESS is about showing them the half-built carcass on your way down. Both are important if you want great people to jump off the cliff with you.\\n\\n#### **How Canny communicates their progress**\\n\\nTo give candidates a sense that things are moving, that this company is not some long slog but a place where progress is made every day, that they can become a part of something that\u2019s growing and, therefore, can grow themselves, to do all that, Canny does two things.\\n\\n##### **\u201cYear in review\u201d blog posts**\\n\\nThe first one is their \u201cYear in review\u201d blog post series. Such comprehensive, thoughtful reviews are rare in the startup world. What is even rarer is when these posts span over four consecutive years. It sends a message that the founders are persistent and devoted to making this company successful.\\n\\nBelow are all Canny\u2019s year-in-review posts in a sequential order:\\n\\n- [Year in review: Lessons learned from bootstrapping our SaaS startup](https://canny.io/blog/lessons-learned-bootstrapping-saas/)\\n- [Year in review: Lessons from our second year of bootstrapping Canny](https://canny.io/blog/year-two-lessons-bootstrapping/)\\n- [Year three in review: Lessons from growing our bootstrapped startup](https://canny.io/blog/year-three-lessons-bootstrapped-startup/)\\n- [Year four in review: Overcoming the unexpected](https://canny.io/blog/year-four-in-review/)\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"A screenshot of Canny\'s Year in review blog post\\"\\n    source=\\"img/worth-joining/canny-year-in-review-min.png\\"\\n    caption=\\"\\"\\n/>\\n\\n##### **Important revenue milestones blog posts**\\n\\nIn addition to year-in-review posts, Sarah writes about hitting notable revenue milestones. Like with yearly reviews, such transparency is rare. It attracts attention, causes liking, and builds trust.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\n- [$0 to $3,500: How we Bootstrapped our SaaS Startup to Ramen Profitability](https://canny.io/blog/saas-startup-ramen-profitability/)\\n- [$3,5k to $1m: How we built a $1m ARR SaaS startup](https://canny.io/blog/how-we-built-a-1m-arr-saas-startup/)\\n- [$1m to $2m: How we\u2019re moving our SaaS upmarket to enterprise sales](https://canny.io/blog/moving-upmarket/)\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"A screenshot of Canny\'s How we built a $1m ARR SaaS startup blog post\\"\\n    source=\\"img/worth-joining/canny-million-arr-min.png\\"\\n    caption=\\"\\"\\n/>\\n\\n##### **Short tweets with progress summary**\\n\\nFinally, Sarah occasionally tweets short summaries of their progress, like [this one](https://twitter.com/sarahhum/status/1461378442256072712). These tweets work like ads. Over time, a candidate\u2019s brain fuses them into a broader idea like \u201cCanny is growing\u201d or \u201cCanny is doing well.\u201d Then, once a candidate decides to change jobs, it nudges the candidate to consider Canny.\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"A screenshot of Sarah\u2019s tweet with progress update\\"\\n    source=\\"img/worth-joining/canny-sarah-tweet-min.png\\"\\n    caption=\\"\\"\\n/>\\n\\n#### **How Fibery communicates their progress**\\n\\n##### **Startup Diary blog posts**\\n\\nThe most notable thing Fibery does to communicate their progress is the [Startup Diary](https://fibery.io/blog/startup-diary) blog posts series written by the founder, Michael, every month, *for the past 45 months.* It\u2019s the longest series of monthly updates I know. In these posts, Michael honestly shares everything that\u2019s going on with the company: the good, the bad, and the ugly.\\n\\nBelow are just a few examples, selected by me. You can study all Fibery\u2019s monthly updates here.\\n\\n- [#2 Slow September 2018](https://fibery.io/blog/chronicles-2/) \u2014 Fibery startup progress in September 2018. Slow month with not so many news. First positive feedback.

Or, more exactly, an understanding that Fibery is *persistently* making progress and, therefore, has a decent chance to become successful. Delivered through these very updates.\\n\\n*Last year, Michael (Fibery\u2019s CEO) started writing year-in-review posts too. I didn\u2019t mention them because there\u2019s just one post for now. You can read his 2021 review [here](https://fibery.io/blog/fibery-2021/).*\\n\\n##### **Open Startup page with metrics**\\n\\nThe second tool that Fibery employs to share their progress is the [/open-startup page](https://fibery.io/open-startup). Like monthly updates, it gives candidates a good idea of how the business is doing. This understanding, however, comes from a different source: pure numbers. And numbers often speak louder than words.\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"A screenshot of Fibery\'s Open startup page\\"\\n    source=\\"img/worth-joining/fibery-open-min.png\\"\\n    caption=\\"\\"\\n/>\\n\\n#### **How PostHog communicates their progress**\\n\\n##### **Story page in the handbook**\\n\\nIn the PostHog\u2019s handbook, they have a page called [Story](https://posthog.com/handbook/company/story). It succinctly shows the milestones the company has hit so far. For each milestone, they offer a clear and concise explanation of what happened, sometimes no longer than a sentence. As a result, candidates can get a good idea of how things are going *in less than a minute.* That\u2019s something to aspire to.\\n\\nHere\u2019s the section titles:\\n\\n- Jan 2020: The start\\n- Feb 2020: Launch\\n- Apr 2020: $3M Seed round\\n- May 2020: First 1,000 users\\n- Oct 2020: Billions of events supported\\n- Nov 2020: Building a platform\\n- Dec 2020: $9M Series A\\n- Jun 2021: $15M Series B\\n- Sep 2021: Product Market fit achieved for PostHog Scale\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"A screenshot of PostHog\'s Story page\\"\\n    source=\\"img/worth-joining/posthog-story-min.png\\"\\n    caption=\\"\\"\\n/>\\n\\n#### **How we at Wasp communicate our progress**\\n\\n##### **Blog posts covering big milestones (YC, $1.5m seed)**\\n\\nFor each milestone, Matija and Martin (Wasp founders) write a blog post describing not only what they accomplished but also *how* they did it.\\n\\nFor example, when Wasp got into YC, they didn\u2019t just post the news on Twitter. They wrote a blog about [their journey to Y Combinator](https://wasp-lang.dev/blog/2021/02/23/journey-to-ycombinator). It got thousands of views.\\n\\nSame with fundraising. When Wasp closed a $1.5m seed, Matija documented and shared their fundraising learnings in [a blog post](https://wasp-lang.dev/blog/2021/11/22/fundraising-learnings). It ended up on the HN frontpage. (Incidentally, this post communicates something important about the founders. It takes persistence to run 250+ meetings in 98 days.)\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"A screenshot of Wasp\'s fundraising learnings blog post\\"\\n    source=\\"img/worth-joining/wasp-fundraising-learnings-post-min.png\\"\\n    caption=\\"\\"\\n/>\\n\\n##### **Monthly newsletter with updates**\\n\\nTo keep the momentum, Matija also writes [a monthly newsletter](https://us4.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=8139c7de74df98aa17054b235&id=f0c6ba5f1d). It\u2019s similar to Michael\u2019s Startup Diary in substance, but has a different style. Wasp style. (Which, again, communicates our culture.)\\n\\nLike PostHog\u2019s Story page, Wasp\u2019s monthly updates give candidates a bird\u2019s eye view over everything that\u2019s happened in the past two years. To anyone interested in connecting the dots, this page is a gem.\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"A screenshot of Wasp\'s monthly newsletter archives\\"\\n    source=\\"img/worth-joining/wasp-monthly-newsletter-min.png\\"\\n    caption=\\"\\"\\n/>\\n\\n## **So, why should people join your startup?**\\n\\n*The founders are interesting / fun / smart / human / you name it*\\n\\n*The team is great*\\n\\n*The culture is amazing*\\n\\n*The business is doing well*\\n\\nBy communicating all these reasons well, what Canny, Fibery, PostHog, and (we hope!) Wasp really end up transmitting is two powerful messages:\\n\\n- The company is likely to succeed\\n- Working there will be awesome\\n\\nThese two messages are the real answer to \u201cwhy people should join your company.\u201d The trick, however, and the reason why I wrote this post, is that you can only transmit them indirectly. You can\u2019t say \u201cour founders are great.\u201d You need to provide candidates with many-many facts about the founders, which their minds will then fuse into this abstract conclusion. Ditto for expertise, team, culture, and progress. Eventually, these first-level abstractions will blend into still broader ones: \u201cthe company is likely to succeed\u201d and \u201cworking there will be awesome.\u201d\\n\\nThus, there\u2019s no single, ultimate answer to \u201cwhy people should join your company.\u201d There\u2019s only a complex system of concrete, specific units of information from which candidates make the answer themselves. In other words, you can\u2019t teach them why your company is likely to succeed and why working here will be awesome. But you can outline the facts and let them learn for themselves. I hope this post shows how to do that outlining well, and I hope you will apply this knowledge to bring talented people onboard and build great things."},{"id":"/2022/06/24/ML-code-gen-vs-coding-by-hand-future","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2022/06/24/ML-code-gen-vs-coding-by-hand-future","editUrl":"https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/edit/main/web/blog/blog/2022-06-24-ML-code-gen-vs-coding-by-hand-future.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-06-24-ML-code-gen-vs-coding-by-hand-future.md","title":"ML code generation vs. coding by hand - what we think programming is going to look like","description":"We are working on a config language / DSL for building web apps that integrates with React & Node.js.

Isn\u2019t Github Copilot\\\\* soon going to be generating all the code for developers anyhow?*\u201d.\\n\\nThis is on our take on the situation and what we think things might look like in the future.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n:::danger Trending post!\\n\\nThis post was trending on HackerNews - you can see the discussion [here](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32098144).\\n\\n:::\\n\\n## Why (ML) code generation?\\n\\nIn order to make development faster, we came up with IDE autocompletion - e.g. if you are using React and start typing `componentDid`, IDE will automatically offer to complete it to `componentDidMount()` or `componentDidLoad()`. Besides saving keystrokes, maybe even more valuable is being able to see what methods/properties are available to us within a current scope. IDE being aware of the project structure and code hierarchy also makes refactoring much easier.\\n\\n**Although that\u2019s already great, how do we take it to the next level?** Traditional IDE support is based on rules written by humans and if we e.g. wanted to make IDE capable of implementing common functions for us, there would be just too many of them to catalogize and maintain by hand.\\n\\nIf there was only a way for a computer to analyze all the code we\u2019ve written so far and learn by itself how to autocomplete our code and what to do about humanity in general, instead of us doing all the hard work ...\\n\\nDelicious and moist cake aside, we actually have this working! Thanks to the latest advances in machine learning, IDEs can now do some really cool things like proposing the full implementation of a function, based on its name and the accompanying comments:\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"Copilot example - text sentiment\\"\\n    source=\\"img/copilot-example-sentiment.gif\\"\\n    caption=\\"GitHub Copilot generating a whole function body based on its signature and the comments on top of it.\\"\\n/>\\n\\nThis is pretty amazing! The example above is powered by [Github Copilot](https://copilot.github.com/) - it\u2019s essentially a neural network trained on a huge amount of publicly available code. I will not get into the technical details of how it works under the hood, but there are [lots](https://betterprogramming.pub/ai-review-github-copilot-d43afde51a5a#:~:text=They%20fine%2Dtuned%20the%20Codex,code%20it\'s%20been%20trained%20on.) [of great](https://www.fast.ai/2021/07/19/copilot/) [articles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03374) covering the science behind it.\\n\\n**Seeing this, questions arise - what does this mean for the future of programming**? Is this just IDE autocompletion on steroids or something more? Do we need to keep bothering with manually writing code, if we can just type in the comments what we want and that\u2019s it?\\n\\n## Who maintains the code once it\u2019s generated?\\n\\nWhen thinking about how ML code generation affects the overall development process, there is one thing to consider that often doesn\u2019t immediately spring to mind when looking at the impressive Copilot examples.\\n\\n:::note\\nFor the purposes of this post, I will not delve into the questions of code quality, [security](https://www.theinsaneapp.com/2021/09/github-copilot-generated-40-percent-insecure-code.html), [legal & privacy issues](https://fosspost.org/github-copilot/), pricing, and others of similar character that are often brought up in these early days of ML code generation. Let\u2019s just assume all this is sorted out and see what happens next.\\n:::\\n\\n**The question is - what happens with the code once it is generated? Who is responsible for it and who will maintain and refactor it in the future?**\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"Devs still need to maintain generated code\\"\\n    source=\\"img/always-has-been-copilot.png\\"\\n/>\\n\\nAlthough ML code generation helps with getting the initial code written, it cannot do much beyond that - if that code is to be maintained and changed in the future (and if anyone uses the product, it is), the developer still needs to fully own and understand it.\\n\\nImagine all we had was an assembly language, but IDE completion worked really well for it, and you could say \u201cimplement a function that sorts an array, ascending\u201d and it would produce the required code perfectly. Would that still be something you\u2019d like to return to in the future once you need to change your sort to descending \ud83d\ude05\xa0? \\n\\nIn other words, it means Copilot and similar solutions do not reduce the code complexity nor the amount of knowledge required to build features, they just help write the initial code faster, and bring the knowledge/examples closer to the code (which is really helpful). If a developer accepts the generated code blindly, they are just creating tech debt and pushing it forward.\\n\\n## Meet the big A - Abstraction \ud83d\udc46\\n\\nIf Github Copilot and others cannot solve all our troubles of learning how to code and understanding in detail how session management via JWT works, what can? \\n\\nAbstraction - that\u2019s how programmers have been dealing with the code repetition and reducing complexity for decades - by creating libraries, frameworks, and languages. It is how we advanced from vanilla JS and direct DOM manipulation to jQuery and finally to UI libraries such as React and Vue.\\n\\nIntroducing abstractions inevitably means giving up on a certain amount of power and flexibility (e.g. when summing numbers in Python you don\u2019t get to exactly specify which CPU registers are going to be used for it), but the point is that, if done right, you don\u2019t need nor want such power in the majority of the cases.\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"Abstraction equals less responsibility\\"\\n    source=\\"img/uncle-ben-great-power.jpg\\"\\n    caption=\\"What Uncle Ben actually meant: avoiding responsibility is the main benefit of abstraction! (Peter totally missed the point, unfortunately, and became Spiderman instead of learning how to code)\\"\\n/>\\n\\n**The only way not to be responsible for a piece of code is that it doesn\u2019t exist in the first place**. \\n\\nBecause as soon as pixels on the screen change their color it\u2019s something you have to worry about, and that is why the main benefit of all frameworks, languages, etc. is *less code* == *less decisions* == *less responsibility.*\\n\\nThe only way to have less code is to make less decisions and provide fewer details to the computer on how to do a certain task - ideally, we\u2019d just state what we want and we wouldn\u2019t even care about how it is done, as long as it\u2019s within the time/memory/cost boundaries we have (so we might need to state those as well).\\n\\nLet\u2019s take a look at the very common (and everyone\u2019s favorite) feature in the world of web apps - authentication (yaay \u2620\ufe0f\xa0\ud83d\udd2b)! The typical code for it will look something like this:\\n\\n```js title=\\"Auth on the backend in Node.js - example\\"\\nimport jwt from \'jsonwebtoken\'\\nimport SecurePassword from \'secure-password\'\\nimport util from \'util\'\\n\\nimport prisma from \'../dbClient.js\'\\nimport { handleRejection } from \'../utils.js\'\\nimport config from \'../config.js\'\\n\\nconst jwtSign = util.promisify(jwt.sign)\\nconst jwtVerify = util.promisify(jwt.verify)\\n\\nconst JWT_SECRET = config.auth.jwtSecret\\n\\nexport const sign = (id, options) => jwtSign({ id }, JWT_SECRET, options)\\nexport const verify = (token) => jwtVerify(token, JWT_SECRET)\\n\\nconst auth = handleRejection(async (req, res, next) => {\\n  const authHeader = req.get(\'Authorization\')\\n  if (!authHeader) {\\n    return next()\\n  }\\n\\n  if (authHeader.startsWith(\'Bearer \')) {\\n    const token = authHeader.substring(7, authHeader.length)\\n\\n    let userIdFromToken\\n    try {\\n      userIdFromToken = (await verify(token)).id\\n    } catch (error) {\\n      if ([\'TokenExpiredError\', \'JsonWebTokenError\', \'NotBeforeError\'].includes(error.name)) {\\n        return res.status(401).send()\\n      } else {\\n        throw error\\n      }\\n    }\\n\\n    const user = await prisma.user.findUnique({ where: { id: userIdFromToken } })\\n    if (!user) {\\n      return res.status(401).send()\\n    }\\n\\n    const { password, ...userView } = user\\n\\n    req.user = userView\\n  } else {\\n    return res.status(401).send()\\n  }\\n\\n  next()\\n})\\n\\nconst SP = new SecurePassword()\\n\\nexport const hashPassword = async (password) => {\\n  const hashedPwdBuffer = await SP.hash(Buffer.from(password))\\n  return hashedPwdBuffer.toString(\\"base64\\")\\n}\\n\\nexport const verifyPassword = async (hashedPassword, password) => {\\n  try {\\n    return await SP.verify(Buffer.from(password), Buffer.from(hashedPassword, \\"base64\\"))\\n  } catch (error) {\\n    console.error(error)\\n    return false\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nAnd this is just a portion of the backend code (and for the username & password method only)! As you can see, we have quite a lot of flexibility here and get to do/specify things like:\\n\\n- choose the implementation method for auth (e.g. session or JWT-based)\\n- choose the exact npm packages we want to use for the token (if going with JWT) and password management\\n- parse the auth header and specify for each value (`Authorization`, `Bearer`, \u2026) how to respond\\n- choose the return code (e.g. 401, 403) for each possible outcome\\n- choose how the password is decoded/encoded (base64)\\n\\nOn one hand, it\u2019s really cool to have that level of control and flexibility in our code, but on the other hand, it\u2019s quite a lot of decisions (== mistakes) to be made, especially for something as common as authentication!\\n\\nIf somebody later asks \u201c*so why exactly did you choose secure-password npm package, or why exactly base64 encoding?*\u201d it\u2019s something we should probably answer with something else rather than \u201c*well, there was that SO post from 2012 that seemed pretty legit, it had almost 50 upvotes. Hmm, can\u2019t find it now though. Plus, it has \u2018secure\u2019 in the name, that sounds good, right?*\u201d\\n\\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that we should also track how things change over time, and make sure that after a couple of years we\u2019re still using the best practices and that the packages are regularly updated.\\n\\nIf we try to apply the principles from above (less code, less detailed instructions, stating **what** we want instead of **how** it needs to be done), the code for auth might look something like this: \\n\\n```css\\nauth: {\\n    userEntity: User,\\n    externalAuthEntity: SocialLogin,\\n    methods: {\\n      usernameAndPassword: {},\\n      google: {}\\n    },\\n    onAuthFailedRedirectTo: \\"/login\\",\\n    onAuthSucceededRedirectTo: \\"/dashboard\\"\\n  }\\n```\\nBased on this, the computer/compiler could take care of all the stuff mentioned above, and then depending on the level of abstraction, provide some sort of interface (e.g. form components, or functions) to \u201chook\u201d in with our own e.g. React/Node.js code (btw this is how it actually [works in Wasp](/docs/language/features#authentication--authorization)).\\n\\nWe don\u2019t need to care what exact packages or encryption methods are used beneath the hood - it is the responsibility we trust with the authors and maintainers of the abstraction layer, just like we trust that Python knows the best how to sum two numbers on the assembly level and that it is kept in sync with the latest advancements in the field. The same happens when we rely on the built-in data structures or count on the garbage collector to manage our program\u2019s memory well.\\n\\n## But my beautiful generated codez \ud83d\ude3f\ud83d\udcbb! What happens with it then?\\n\\nDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s all still here and you can generate all the code you wish! The main point to understand here is that ML code generation and framework/language development complement rather than replace each other and are here to stay, which is ultimately a huge win for the developer community - they will keep making our lives easier and allow us to do more fun stuff (instead of implementing auth or CRUD API for the n-th time)!\\n\\nI see the evolution here as a cycle (or an upward spiral in fact, but that\u2019s beyond my drawing capabilities):\\n\\n1. **language/framework exists**, is mainstream, and a lot of people use it\\n2. **patterns start emerging** (e.g. implementing auth, or making an API call) \u2192 ML captures them, offers via autocomplete\\n3. **some of those patterns mature** and become stable \u2192 candidates for abstraction\\n4. **new, more abstract, language/framework** emerges\\n5. **back to step 1**.\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"Language evolution lifecycle\\"\\n    source=\\"img/language-lifecycle-copilot.png\\"\\n    caption=\\"It\u2019s the circle of (language) life, and it moves us all - Ingonyama nengw\' enamabala, \u2026\\"\\n/>\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nThis means we are winning on both sides - when the language is mainstream we can benefit from ML code generation, helping us write the code faster. On the other hand, when the patterns of code we don\u2019t want to repeat/deal with emerge and become stable we get a whole new language or framework that allows us to write even less code and care about fewer implementation details!\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n    alt=\\"Fizz Buzz with Copilot - stop\\"\\n    source=\\"img/fizz-buzz-copilot-stop.gif\\"\\n    caption=\\"The future is now, old man.\\"\\n/>\\n\\n\\n\\\\**Not to be biased, there are also other solutions offering similar functionality - e.g. [TabNine](https://www.tabnine.com/), [Webstorm has its own](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/webstorm/auto-completing-code.html#ml_completion), [Kite](https://www.kite.com/), [GPT Code Clippy (OSS attempt)](https://github.com/CodedotAl/gpt-code-clippy) et al., but Github Copilot recently made the biggest splash.*\\n\\n### Writing that informed this post\\n- [Is GitHub Copilot a blessing, or a curse?

(Or, maybe you\u2019re doing some fancy blockchain thing for that frothy investment multiple; :D whatever it is, just envision an operation that may take a significant amount of time and/or fail.) How would you implement this?\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n  <img alt=\\"Spinning!\\"\\n      src={useBaseUrl(\'img/jobs-spinner.gif\')}\\n      width=\\"30px\\"\\n  />\\n</p>\\n\\nYou wouldn\u2019t want the server to delay sending its HTTP response until those are done (unless you are one of those people who love seeing the Mac spinning icon), so you\'ll need something out-of-band from the normal request-response flow. Even in an event-loop-based system like Node.js, just calling an async function isn\'t ideal since you will need to handle failures, retries, and throttling, amongst other concerns. And sometimes we need to schedule tasks to run in the future, or repeatedly, so we need a completely different toolset.\\n\\nThe typical solution here is to use a job queue of some kind. They are not impossible to set up, of course, but there is a fair amount of boilerplate involved, some operational expertise/overhead required, and moving from one system to another when you outgrow it is usually a challenge. These are the exact areas where we feel Wasp can provide real value, so we are happy to introduce Wasp Jobs to help out with this!\\n\\n```js title=src/server/workers/github.js\\nimport axios from \'axios\'\\nimport { upsertMetric } from \'./utils.js\'\\n\\nexport async function workerFunction() {\\n  const response = await axios.get(\'https://api.github.com/repos/wasp-lang/wasp\')\\n\\n  const metrics = [\\n    { name: \'Wasp GitHub Stars\', value: response.data.stargazers_count },\\n    { name: \'Wasp GitHub Language\', value: response.data.language },\\n    { name: \'Wasp GitHub Forks\', value: response.data.forks },\\n    { name: \'Wasp GitHub Open Issues\', value: response.data.open_issues },\\n  ]\\n\\n  await Promise.all(metrics.map(upsertMetric))\\n\\n  return metrics\\n}\\n```\\n\\nWasp allows you to write a regular async JavaScript function (like the one above that gathers GitHub metrics and stores them in the DB) and have it run within the context of a job queue system, which we call an executor. You can manually submit work to be done on the server, or specify a cron schedule to have your job automatically invoked. And, best of all, as we add more job executors in the future, you can change where it runs on a single line in your .wasp file.\\n\\n## Most jobs have a boss. Our first job executor is a... pg-boss. \ud83d\ude05\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n  <figure>\\n    <img alt=\\"Eeek\\"\\n        src={useBaseUrl(\'img/jobs-eyes.gif\')}\\n    />\\n    <figcaption>Me trying to lay off the job-related puns. Ok, ok, I\u2019ll quit. Ahhh!</figcaption>\\n  </figure>\\n</p>\\n\\nIn my prior life as a Ruby on Rails developer, the decision of how to implement jobs was pretty simple. You had Active Job at your disposal, and for backends, you would use something like Sidekiq or Delayed Job. In a similarly paved path, Python developers would have likely looked first to Celery.\\n\\nIn the JavaScript world, [Bull](https://github.com/OptimalBits/bull) is quite popular these days. However, we decided to use [pg-boss](https://github.com/timgit/pg-boss), as it too provides persistence, delayed jobs, and schedules (plus many other features). But critically, pg-boss uses PostgreSQL instead of Redis (like Bull) for storage and coordination, and this was important since we did not want to introduce any new infrastructure dependencies to our existing production stack.\\n\\nBut isn\u2019t a database as a queue an anti-pattern, you may ask? Well, historically I\u2019d probably say yes. However, PostgreSQL 9.5 added SKIP LOCKED, which it specifically mentions can aid in avoiding lock contention with multiple consumer queue-like workloads [[https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/sql-select.html#SQL-FOR-UPDATE-SHARE](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/sql-select.html#SQL-FOR-UPDATE-SHARE)]. So for the low-volume background job workloads that many apps have, we feel using a database as a queue is a great compromise and starting point for many users from a benefit vs. complexity perspective.\\n\\nHowever, we will also continue to expand the number of job execution runtimes we support. Let us know in [Discord](https://discord.gg/rzdnErX) what you\u2019d like to see next!\\n\\n## Real Example - Updating Waspleau\\n\\nIf you are a regular reader of this blog (thank you, you deserve a raise! \ud83d\ude0a), you may recall we created an example app of a metrics dashboard called [Waspleau](https://wasp-lang.dev/blog/2022/01/27/waspleau) that used workers in the background to make periodic HTTP calls for data. In that example, we didn\u2019t yet have access to recurring jobs in Wasp, so we used Bull for scheduled jobs instead. To set up our queue-related logic we had to have this huge `setupFn` wiring it all up; but now, we can remove all that code and simply use jobs instead! Here is what the new DSL looks like:\\n\\n```js title=main.wasp\\n// A cron job for fetching GitHub stats\\njob getGithubStats {\\n  executor: PgBoss,\\n  perform: {\\n    fn: import { workerFunction } from \\"@server/workers/github.js\\"\\n  },\\n  schedule: {\\n    cron: \\"*/10 * * * *\\"\\n  }\\n}\\n\\n// A cron job to measure how long a webpage takes to load\\njob calcPageLoadTime {\\n  executor: PgBoss,\\n  perform: {\\n    fn: import { workerFunction } from \\"@server/workers/loadTime.js\\"\\n  },\\n  schedule: {\\n    cron: \\"*/5 * * * *\\",\\n    args: {=json {\\n      \\"url\\": \\"https://wasp-lang.dev\\",\\n      \\"name\\": \\"wasp-lang.dev Load Time\\"\\n    } json=}\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nAnd here is an example of how you can reference and invoke jobs on the server. *Note: We did not even need to do this step since jobs with a schedule are automatically configured to run at the desired time.*\\n```js title=src/server/serverSetup.js\\n/**\\n* These Jobs are automatically scheduled by Wasp.\\n* However, let\'s kick them off on server setup to ensure we have data right away.\\n*/\\nimport { github } from \'@wasp/jobs/getGithubStats.js\'\\nimport { loadTime } from \'@wasp/jobs/calcPageLoadTime.js\'\\n\\nexport default async function () {\\n  await github.submit()\\n  await loadTime.submit({\\n    url: \\"https://wasp-lang.dev\\",\\n    name: \\"wasp-lang.dev Load Time\\"\\n  })\\n}\\n```\\n\\nAnd voila, it is really that simple. Wasp takes care of setting up pg-boss and hooking up all your job callbacks, leaving you to focus on what matters- your own code. Here is a visual of what is happening behind the scenes:\\n\\n![Architecture](../static/img/jobs-arch.png)\\n\\nFor those interested, check out the [full diff here](https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/commit/1721371fc73f4485ca0046aafea2ee3fc0be41cf#diff-e158328e137176b595ad01641ba68faf82dbb88ccc5be3597009bb576fcd6505) and weep with joy for all those boilerplate lines of code we fired! We were also able to ax Redis from our infrastructure!\\n\\n## Looks neat! What\u2019s next?\\n\\nFirst off, please check out our docs for Jobs: [https://wasp-lang.dev/docs/language/features#jobs](https://wasp-lang.dev/docs/language/features#jobs) There, you will find all the info you need to start using them. Next, if you want to see the code for this example in full, you can find it here: [https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/tree/release/examples/waspleau](https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/tree/release/examples/waspleau)\\n\\nIn the future, we plan to add more job executors, including support for polyglot workers (imagine running your Python ML function from Wasp!). We are also open to any other ideas on how jobs can become more useful to you (like client-side access to server-side jobs, or client-side jobs using similar abstractions?).

[Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/) spins up fresh, automated developer environments in the cloud, in seconds. A perfect tandem to win a hackathon and enjoy free pizza even before other teams even started to set up their coding env and realized they need to update their node version. \\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n<WaspIntro />\\n<InBlogCta />\\n\\n## Intro:\\n\\nUsually, every hackathon starts from similar activities:<br/>\\n1) **setting up a local dev environment**, especially if all the team members use different operating systems. There are always issues with the SDK/packages/compiler, etc.<br/>\\n2) **building project backbone** (folder structure, basic services, CRUD APIs, and so on).\\n\\nBoth of them are time-consuming, boring, and cause issues.\\n\\n![Dealing with routine might be frustrating](../static/img/I-quit.gif)\\n\\nThankfully, those issues can be avoided! Gitpod allows you to spin up a clean, already pre-set dev environment. And Wasp enables you to build a full-stack JS web app with a single config file (alongside your React and Node.js code). But first things first.\\n\\n![Pennywise luring into his openspace](../static/img/hackathon-pennywise.jpg)\\n\\n## Dev environment setup: \\n\\nGitpod spins up a bespoke dev environment in the cloud for any git branch (once you configured it for your project), on-demand. So you can start coding right away. Build, debug, commit and push your code in seconds, without any local SDK issues. After you\u2019ve finished \u2013 you can host your app after a couple of clicks and share the project with your teammate. You can even make changes to the same project simultaneously, leveraging a pair programming approach. \\n\\nSince Gitpod is a cloud-based workspace \u2013 spinning up a new application takes a couple of clicks. \\n\\n1) Fork https://github.com/gitpod-io/template-wasp and give it a meaningful name, e.g. \u201cMy Awesome Recipes App\u201d -> this is now a repo for your new web app.<br/>\\n2) In your newly created repo, check the Readme and click the \u201cOpen in Gitpod\u201d button<br/>\\n3) Login via Github<br/>\\n4) Allow pop-ups<br/>\\n5) That\u2019s it! Enjoy your fresh cloud-based dev environment!<br/>\\n\\n![Pennywise luring to take part in hackathon](../static/img/gitpod-roadmap.png)\\n\\nAn optional thing might be enabling the \u201cShare\u201d option to make the app accessible from the external internet. \\n\\n![How to share a workspace](../static/img/gitpod-share.jpg)\\n\\nYou can pick up one of the following IDE\u2019s, switch between light/dark themes and you can even install all your favorite extensions. \\n\\n![Gitpod IDE types](../static/img/gitpod-ide.jpg)\\n\\nSo, eventually, the workflow can look like this: someone from the team forks the template repo and shares it with others. Teammates open this repo in Gitpod, creating their own dev branches. \\n\\nVoila! \ud83e\udd73\\n\\nThe whole team is ready to code in a matter of seconds. After the team is done with the development, someone can pull all the changes, share the project, and present it to the judges. \\n\\nNo need to fix local issues, ensure the Node version is aligned, or configure the deployment pipeline for DigitalOcean. Gitpod does all development preparations. The only thing the team has to do \u2013 is to implement the idea ASAP. And here Wasp comes into play!\\n\\n## Building project backbone:\\n\\nOk, we\u2019ve successfully set up a shared dev environment. It\u2019s time to create a production-ready web app with just a few lines of code. Based on your needs \u2013 you can declare separate pages, routes, database models, etc. - it\u2019s super easy and intuitive! \\n\\nThe ideal case would be to:<br/>\\n1) Check out the language overview: https://wasp-lang.dev/docs/language/overview <br/>\\n2) Follow a 20-minutes tutorial on how to build a To-Do app with Wasp: https://wasp-lang.dev/docs/tutorials/todo-app <br/>\\n\\nIt may seem a bit inconvenient: why spend time on learning, when you already can start building something meaningful? The short answer is: time-saving. Wasp\u2019s main point is to set you free from building time-consuming boilerplate. So even if you\u2019ll spend half of an hour learning the basics \u2013  you\u2019ll still be able to outrun other hackathon participants. While they will be copy-pasting CRUD API methods \u2013 you\u2019ll be building business logic.\\n\\nAnd 20 minutes is time well spent to become more productive. Setting up each team member\'s environment locally likely takes more than 20 minutes if you don\'t use Gitpod.\\n\\n\\n## To wrap up: \\n\\nWe think that Wasp + Gitpod is a powerful toolset for speedrunning any hackathon. No matter how complex or ambitious your project is. If it\u2019s built with Node and React \u2013 nothing can stop you from winning. Good luck, have fun, and enjoy that pizza \ud83c\udf55!"},{"id":"/2022/05/31/filip-intro","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2022/05/31/filip-intro","editUrl":"https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/edit/main/web/blog/blog/2022-05-31-filip-intro.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-05-31-filip-intro.md","title":"Meet the team - Filip Sodi\u0107, Founding Engineer","description":"Welcome Filip!","date":"2022-05-31T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"May 31, 2022","tags":[{"label":"wasp","permalink":"/blog/tags/wasp"},{"label":"new-hire","permalink":"/blog/tags/new-hire"}],"readingTime":5.09,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Matija Sosic","title":"Co-founder & CEO @ Wasp","url":"https://github.com/matijasos","imageURL":"https://github.com/matijasos.png","key":"matijasos"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Meet the team - Filip Sodi\u0107, Founding Engineer","authors":["matijasos"],"image":"/img/filip-intro-banner.png","tags":["wasp","new-hire"]},"prevItem":{"title":"How to win a hackathon.

Before joining Wasp, Filip earned his stripes in various domains, ranging\\nfrom bioinformatics and the betting industry to route optimisation software.\\nWelcome to the team, Filip - we can\'t wait to see what you build!\\n\\n#### Let\u2019s start with two truths and a lie about yourself.\\n\\n- I found out about Wasp through a friend/former colleague and still haven\u2019t\\n  bought him a drink to say thanks.\\n- I\u2019ve designed and implemented my own Turing-complete functional programming\\n  language that compiles to JavaScript.\\n- I wasted nearly 30 hours customizing my setup to maximize productivity and\\n  probably ended up in a less productive state.\\n\\n#### Which statement was the lie above? Any interesting stories to share?\\n\\nThe last one was a lie. I wish it were only 30 hours :)\\n\\nI did design [a programming language](https://sodic.github.io/func). It is\\nTuring-complete but still far from being practical. For one, it can\u2019t print\\nstuff to the screen (or perform any other side effects).\\n\\nI never did buy that drink. He\u2019s not letting me forget about it, though.\\n\\n#### Why did you join Wasp? What did you do before?\\n\\nI\'ve wanted to work on a project where I\'d get a chance to design a language\\nand build a compiler for quite some time now. While I did develop my own\\nlanguage on the side (and even graduated with it), I thought getting paid for\\ndoing something similar this early in my career was pretty far-fetched.\\n\\nAlmost all my paid work had something to do with the web, whether on the\\nclient-side or the server-side. I enjoy nearly all parts of web development\\n(yes, even styling websites with CSS :), but one thing I\'ve always found\\nannoying was dealing with all the boilerplate. Whenever I start building\\nsomething, I spend most of my time implementing the same repetitive stuff\\n(e.g., authentication, databases, SPA routing, API routes, etc.) and relearning\\nall the best practices that come with it.\\n\\nAnd then, one day, a friend of mine mentioned Wasp - a DSL aiming to eliminate\\nboilerplate from web apps. The product was a perfect fit based on everything I\\nknow and want to do! Also, I shared a college advisor with the founders (Martin\\nand Matija) and only heard great things about them.\\n\\nThe whole thing sounded almost too good to be true, so joining them to work on\\nWasp was an easy decision.\\n\\n#### What is your favorite language?\\n\\nI don\u2019t have many favorite things, especially when it comes to technology.\\nAfter going through several cycles of falling in love with a\\nlanguage/framework/tool before becoming annoyed by its shortcomings and\\nlimitations, I made peace with the fact that everything\u2019s a tradeoff. I\u2019ll\\ngenerally choose a language depending on:\\n- the problem at hand\\n- its current position in the aforementioned cycle :)\\n\\nWith that said, I\'m currently most excited about properly learning Haskell. It\\nalways looked interesting and exotic. I\'ve gotten a few opportunities to play\\nwith the language through university courses and on my own but never really had\\nan excuse to use it in my day-to-day.\\n\\n#### What are you most excited about in Wasp?\\n\\nFrom a developer\u2019s perspective, I\u2019m definitely most excited about designing the\\nDSL and working on the compiler.\\n\\nFrom a product standpoint, I love the idea of never again having to implement\\nan authentication system.\\n\\n#### What\u2019s a feature or project you\u2019re most proud of that you worked on in the past three months?\\n\\n[Definitely this thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ).\\n\\n#### How did you start coding?\\n\\nNo exciting story to tell here, I\u2019m afraid.\\n\\nI enrolled in computer science college and first started programming as a part\\nof my regular \u201cIntroduction to programming\u201d course.\\n\\nBefore then, I didn\u2019t really know what programming was. In fact, I  wanted to\\nstudy electrical engineering. Unluckily for most but luckily for me, our\\ncollege does not let you choose your major (i.e., electrical engineering or\\ncomputing) right away. Instead, they make you go through a shared year of\\nuniversal (and some not-so-universal) courses, only allowing you to specialize\\nat the start of your second year. Thanks to this quirk, I had a chance to\\nencounter programming, change my mind, and enroll in computer science.\\n\\n#### Your dev setup?\\n\\nAs far as hardware goes, it\u2019s pretty basic. I use a regular laptop that\u2019s\\nstarting to show signs of age (ASUS N550JX), a cheap Lenovo mouse, and my\\nlaptop\u2019s integrated keyboard.\\n\\nThe software setup is a bit more interesting. I\u2019m usually on Manjaro Linux with\\nthe i3 tiling window manager. I jump between editors depending on what I\u2019m\\ndoing. It\u2019s sometimes Vim, but mainly something more powerful that comes with\\nVim emulation (e.g., VS Code or JetBrains IDEs). My preferred shell is zsh\\n(sorry Frane).\\n\\n#### `camelCase` or `snake_case`?\\n\\nNoPreference\\n\\n#### What is your current favorite gem, library, tool, or anything else that helps you with your work? Why?\\n\\nThat would have to be [ranger](https://github.com/ranger/ranger)!\\n\\nRanger is a terminal file manager I use daily, mainly because it makes my work\\nin the shell much faster.

Wouldn\u2019t it be great if there was a quick and easy way to build a nice-looking metrics dashboard from data pulled in by HTTP calls to many different sources, cache the data in-memory, and periodically update it via background jobs? Why yes, yes it would... so we made an example Wasp app called Waspleau that does just that!\\n\\nHere is what it looks like live: https://waspleau.netlify.app/ There is also a screenshot at the top of this post for those who refrain from clicking on any unknown web links for fear of being **Rickrolled**. Respect.\\n\\n## \u201cShow me the code\u201d\\n\\nSo, what do we need to get started? First, we need a way to schedule and run jobs; for this, we decided to use [Bull](https://github.com/OptimalBits/bull). Ok, let\u2019s wire it up. This should be easy, right? We can add external NPM dependencies in our Wasp files like so:\\n\\n```css title=\\"main.wasp\\"\\napp waspleau {\\n  title: \\"Waspleau\\",\\n\\n  dependencies: [\\n    (\\"bull\\", \\"4.1.1\\"),\\n    (\\"axios\\", \\"^0.21.1\\")\\n  ]\\n}\\n```\\n\\nBut where do we declare our queue and processing callback functions in Wasp? Uh oh...\\n\\n![Sad](../static/img/waspleau-sad.png)\\n\\n### `server.setupFn` for queue setup\\n\\nThankfully, Waspleau can leverage a powerful and flexible [hook supplied by Wasp](https://wasp-lang.dev/docs/language/basic-elements#setupfn) called `server.setupFn`. This declares a JavaScript function that will be executed on server start. Yahoo! This means we can do things like the following:\\n\\n```css title=\\"main.wasp\\"\\napp waspleau {\\n  ...\\n\\n  server: {\\n    setupFn: import serverSetup from \\"@server/serverSetup.js\\"\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n```js title=\\"src/server/serverSetup.js\\"\\nimport Queue from \'bull\'\\n\\nconst queue = new Queue(\'waspleau\', process.env.REDIS_URL || \'redis://127.0.0.1:6379\',\\n  { defaultJobOptions: { removeOnComplete: true } }\\n)\\n\\nqueue.process(\'*\', async (job) => { ... })\\n\\nexport default async () => {\\n  // To initially populate the queue, we can do:\\n  await queue.add({ ... }) // first run, one-off job\\n  await queue.add({ ... }, { repeat: { cron: \'*/10 * * * *\' } }) // recurring job\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Abstracting workers and job processing\\n\\nAwesome, we can now enqueue and process background jobs, but how can we make it easy to create many different kinds of jobs and schedule them to run at different intervals? For Waspleau, we created our own type of worker object convention to help standardize and simplify adding more:\\n\\n```js title=\\"src/server/workers/template.js\\"\\nconst workerFunction = async (opts) => {\\n  return [\\n    { name: \'Metric 1 name\', value: \'foo\', updatedAt: ... },\\n    { name: \'Metric 2 name\', value: \'bar\', updatedAt: ... },\\n  ]\\n}\\n\\nexport const workerTemplate = { name: \'Job Name\', fn: workerFunction, schedule: \'*/10 * * * *\' }\\n```\\n\\nWith this `workerFunction` setup, we can return one or more metrics per worker type. Waspleau can easily use any module that exports this shape. Here is a real example from the demo that makes HTTP calls to GitHub\u2019s API with Axios:\\n\\n```js title=\\"src/server/workers/github.js\\"\\nimport axios from \'axios\'\\n\\nconst workerFunction = async (opts) => {\\n  console.log(\'github.js workerFunction\')\\n\\n  const now = Date.now()\\n\\n  try {\\n    const response = await axios.get(\'https://api.github.com/repos/wasp-lang/wasp\')\\n\\n    return [\\n      { name: \'Wasp GitHub Stars\', value: response.data.stargazers_count, updatedAt: now },\\n      { name: \'Wasp GitHub Language\', value: response.data.language, updatedAt: now },\\n      { name: \'Wasp GitHub Forks\', value: response.data.forks, updatedAt: now },\\n      { name: \'Wasp GitHub Open Issues\', value: response.data.open_issues, updatedAt: now },\\n    ]\\n  } catch (error) {\\n    console.error(error)\\n    return []\\n  }\\n}\\n\\nexport const githubWorker = { name: \'GitHub API\', fn: workerFunction, schedule: \'*/10 * * * *\' }\\n```\\n\\n_Note: Please see the [actual serverSetup.js file](https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/blob/release/examples/waspleau/src/server/serverSetup.js) for how we use this abstraction in practice._\\n\\n### Server \u2192 client\\n\\nWe now have jobs running and data updating at regular intervals, nice, but we still need a way to send that data down the wire. Here, we expose the in-memory data from our `server.setupFn` module so our queries can also use it:\\n\\n```css title=\\"main.wasp\\"\\n...\\n\\nquery dashboard {\\n  fn: import { refreshDashboardData } from \\"@server/dashboard.js\\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\n```js title=\\"src/server/dashboard.js\\"\\nimport { getDashboardData } from \'./serverSetup.js\'\\n\\nexport const refreshDashboardData = async (_args, _context) => {\\n  return getDashboardData()\\n}\\n```\\n\\n```js title=\\"src/server/serverSetup.js\\"\\n...\\n\\nconst dashboardData = {} // This is updated in the queue process callback\\nexport const getDashboardData = () => Object.values(dashboardData).flat()\\n```\\n\\nFrom there, we can request it on the frontend in React components as usual and also set a one-minute client-side refetch interval just for good measure:\\n\\n```js title=\\"src/client/MainPage.js\\"\\n...\\n\\nconst { data: dashboardData, isFetching, error } = useQuery(refreshDashboardData, null, { refetchInterval: 60 * 1000 })\\n\\n...\\n```\\n\\n## Congratulations, let\u2019s dance!\\n\\nWhew, we did it! If you\u2019d like to deploy your own customized version of this dashboard, please clone [our repo](https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp) and check out the Waspleau example [README.md](https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/blob/release/examples/waspleau/README.md) for tips on getting started. You can also [check out our docs](https://wasp-lang.dev/docs) to dive deeper into anything.\\n\\n![Rickroll](../static/img/waspleau-rickroll.gif)\\n\\n_Still got ya! :D_\\n\\n## 2022 is going to be exciting \ud83d\ude80\\n\\nWhile this functionality currently exists outside of Wasp, keep an eye on our roadmap as we head toward 1.0.

The technology, problem space, and team were just too compelling to pass up. I was also excited to be on the ground floor of a YC startup, where I can have a significant impact and help build a broad, welcoming, open-source community of Wasp developers.\\n\\n#### What did you do before?\\n\\nI have been a professional developer for over a decade, mostly in backend web development, with experience from Lockheed Martin, Morgan Stanley, NetApp, and Red Hat. Most recently, I was the head of engineering at an edtech company called LearnPlatform, where we were handling a quarter of a billion incoming events per day with the goal of understanding and improving student access to technology that works best for them.\\n\\n#### What is your favorite language/framework?\\n\\nMy favorite framework is probably Ruby on Rails, for the elegance of ideas and seamless implementation. I never had an actual favorite programming language, as I enjoy different aspects of Ruby, Elixir, JavaScript, C#, and others. My least favorite has always been Java. My current favorite language is fast becoming Haskell. :)\\n\\nThe most interesting niche programming language I have used professionally was Ada at Lockheed Martin. We used it to build distributed, real-time, full-motion flight simulators for the military (think multi-million dollar, hyperrealistic multiplayer video games).\\n\\n#### What are you most excited about in Wasp?\\n\\nAs web developers, I think we have gotten accustomed to a certain level of complexity that is not associated with the problem we are solving but the boilerplate of the process. This lack of nuance between accidental and essential complexity has recently led to less than ideal low-code approaches. Wasp, in my view, takes the better approach of a higher-level DSL to abstract some of the typical details using best practices, leaving you to focus on your problem by writing actual code that produces a real web app without any vendor lock-in. That is pretty amazing to me!\\n\\n#### How did you start coding?\\n\\nProbably by creating some basic LAMP apps in the late 90s while in high school. Growing up, our parents wanted us to have summer jobs to earn money we could spend during the rest of the year. I quickly found that freelance web development on Elance, and similar sites, was more enjoyable and profitable than the alternatives available to 15-year-olds. From then on, I was hooked.\\n\\n#### What is your dev setup?\\n\\nMacBook Air M1 with an external Dell display, Magic Trackpad, and a split mechanical keyboard from UHK (Ultimate Hacking Keyboard).\\n\\n#### `camelCase` or `snake_case`?\\n\\nI default to whatever the language or codebase conventions are. Visually, I prefer snake case, though (and definitely spaces over tabs). ;)\\n\\n#### What\'s one piece of advice you\'d give to an aspiring developer?\\n\\nOne of the biggest differentiators I have found between good and great engineers is that the great ones possess a continuous desire to learn and grow. They view challenges as fun opportunities to expand their knowledge and skills, recognizing that they always have room for improvement. The corollary is that impostor syndrome is real and never goes away, so try not to be too hard on yourself along the way!\\n\\n*This post was the first of several new hire announcements in the months to come, so stay tuned and reach out if you want to work with Martin, Shayne, and myself!*\\n\\n<InBlogCta />"},{"id":"/2021/12/02/waspello","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2021/12/02/waspello","editUrl":"https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/edit/main/web/blog/blog/2021-12-02-waspello.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-12-02-waspello.md","title":"How we built a Trello clone with Wasp - Waspello!","description":"Enter Waspello","date":"2021-12-02T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"December 2, 2021","tags":[{"label":"webdev","permalink":"/blog/tags/webdev"},{"label":"wasp","permalink":"/blog/tags/wasp"}],"readingTime":9.225,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Matija Sosic","title":"Co-founder & CEO @ Wasp","url":"https://github.com/matijasos","imageURL":"https://github.com/matijasos.png","key":"matijasos"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"How we built a Trello clone with Wasp - Waspello!","authors":["matijasos"],"tags":["webdev","wasp"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Meet the team - Shayne Czyzewski, Founding Engineer","permalink":"/blog/2021/12/21/shayne-intro"},"nextItem":{"title":"Our fundraising learnings - 250+ meetings in 98 days to the oversubscribed round","permalink":"/blog/2021/11/22/fundraising-learnings"}},"content":"import Link from \'@docusaurus/Link\';\\nimport useBaseUrl from \'@docusaurus/useBaseUrl\';\\nimport InBlogCta from \'./components/InBlogCta\';\\nimport WaspIntro from \'./_wasp-intro.md\';\\nimport ImgWithCaption from \'./components/ImgWithCaption\'\\n\\n![Enter Waspello](../static/img/waspello-screenshot.png)\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n    <Link to={\'https://waspello.netlify.app/\'}>Try Waspello here!</Link> | <Link to={\'https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/blob/release/examples/waspello/main.wasp\'}>See the code</Link>\\n</p>\\n\\nWe\'ve built a Trello clone using Wasp! Read on to learn how it went and how you can contribute. \\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n<WaspIntro />\\n<InBlogCta />\\n\\n## Why Trello?\\n\\nWhile building Wasp, our goal is to use it as much as we can to build our projects and play with it, so we can learn what works and what we should do next. This is why Trello was a great choice of app to build with Wasp - it is one of the most well-known full-stack web apps, it\'s very simple and intuitive to use  but also covers a good portion of features used by today\'s modern web apps.\\n\\nSo let\'s dig in and see and how it went - what works, what doesn\'t and, what\'s missing/coming next!\\n\\n## What works?\\n\\n### It\'s alive \u26a1\ud83e\udd16 !!\\nThe good news is all the basic functionality is here - Waspello users can signup/log in which brings them to their project board where they can perform CRUD operations on lists and cards - create them, edit them, move them around, etc. Let\'s see it in action:\\n\\n![Waspello in action](../static/img/waspello-in-action.gif)\\n<p align=\\"center\\" class=\\"image-caption\\">\\n    Waspello in action!\\n</p>\\n\\nAs you can see things work, but not everything is perfect (e.g. there is a delay when creating/moving a card) - we\'ll examine why is that so a bit later.\\n\\n### Under the hood \ud83d\ude98 \ud83d\udd27\\nHere is a simple visual overview of Waspello\'s code anatomy (which applies to every Wasp app):\\n\\n![Waspello code anatomy](../static/img/waspello-code-anatomy.png)\\n<p align=\\"center\\" class=\\"image-caption\\">\\n    Waspello code anatomy\\n</p>\\n\\nLet\'s now dig in a bit deeper and shortly examine each of the concepts Wasp supports (page, query, entity, ...) and learn through code samples how to use it to implement Waspello.\\n\\n#### Entities\\n\\nIt all starts with a data model definition (called `entity` in Wasp), which is defined via Prisma Schema Language:\\n\\n```js title=\\"main.wasp | Defining entities via Prisma Schema Language\\"\\n// Entities\\n\\nentity User {=psl\\n    id          Int     @id @default(autoincrement())\\n    username    String  @unique\\n    password    String\\n    lists       List[]\\n    cards       Card[]\\npsl=}\\n\\nentity List {=psl\\n    id          Int     @id @default(autoincrement())\\n    name        String\\n    pos         Float\\n\\n    // List has a single author.\\n    user        User    @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])\\n    userId      Int\\n\\n    cards       Card[]\\npsl=}\\n\\nentity Card {=psl\\n    id          Int     @id @default(autoincrement())\\n    title       String\\n    pos         Float\\n\\n    // Card belongs to a single list.\\n    list        List    @relation(fields: [listId], references: [id])\\n    listId      Int\\n\\n    // Card has a single author.\\n    author      User    @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])\\n    authorId    Int\\npsl=}\\n```\\n\\nThose three entities are all we need! Wasp uses Prisma to create a database schema underneath and allows the developer to query it through its generated SDK.\\n\\n#### Queries and Actions (Operations)\\nAfter we\'ve defined our data models, the next step is to do something with them! We can read/create/update/delete an entity and that is what `query` and `action` mechanisms are for. Below follows an example from the Waspello code that demonstrates how it works.\\n\\nThe first step is to declare to Wasp there will be a query, point to the actual function containing the query logic, and state from which entities it will be reading information:\\n```js title=\\"main.wasp | Declaration of a query in Wasp\\"\\nquery getListsAndCards {\\n    // Points to the function which contains query logic.\\n    fn: import { getListsAndCards } from \\"@server/queries.js\\",\\n\\n    // This query depends on List and Card entities.\\n    // If any of them changes this query will get re-fetched (cache invalidation).\\n    entities: [List, Card]\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThe main point of this declaration is for Wasp to be aware of the query and thus be able to **do a lot of heavy lifting for us - e.g. it will make the query available to the client without any extra code**, all that developer needs to do is import it in their React component. **Another big thing is cache invalidation / automatic re-fetching of the query once the data changes** (this is why it is important to declare which entities it depends on).\\n\\nThe remaining step is to write the function with the query logic:\\n```js title=\\"src/server/queries.js | Query logic, using Prisma SDK via Node.js\\"\\nexport const getListsAndCards = async (args, context) => {\\n  // Only authenticated users can execute this query.\\n  if (!context.user) { throw new HttpError(403) }\\n\\n  return context.entities.List.findMany({\\n    // We want to make sure user can access only their own cards.\\n    where: { user: { id: context.user.id } },\\n    include: { cards: true }\\n  })\\n}\\n```\\nThis is just a regular Node.js function, there are no limits on what you can return! All the stuff provided by Wasp (user data, Prisma SDK for a specific entity) comes in a `context` variable.\\n\\nThe code for actions is very similar (we just need to use `action` keyword instead of `query`) so I won\'t repeat it here. You can check out the code for `updateCard` action [here](https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/blob/release/examples/waspello/main.wasp#L103).\\n\\n#### Pages, routing & components\\nTo display all the nice data we have, we\'ll use React components. There are no limits to how you can use React components within Wasp, the only one is that each `page` has its root component:\\n```js title=\\"main.wasp | Declaration of a page & route in Wasp\\"\\nroute MainRoute { path: \\"/\\", to: Main }\\npage Main {\\n    authRequired: true,\\n    component: import Main from \\"@client/MainPage.js\\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\nAll pretty straightforward so far! As you can see here, Wasp also provides [authentication out-of-the-box](/docs/language/features#authentication--authorization).\\n\\nCurrently, the majority of the client logic of Waspello is contained in `src/client/MainPage.js` (we should break it down a little \ud83d\ude05 - [you can help us!](https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/issues/334)). Just to give you an idea, here\'s a quick glimpse into it:\\n\\n```js title=\\"src/client/MainPage.js | Using React component in Wasp\\"\\n// \\"Special\\" imports provided by Wasp.\\nimport { useQuery } from \'@wasp/queries\'\\nimport getListsAndCards from \'@wasp/queries/getListsAndCards\'\\nimport createList from \'@wasp/actions/createList\'\\n\\nconst MainPage = ({ user }) => {\\n  // Fetching data via useQuery.\\n  const { data: listsAndCards, isFetchingListsAndCards, errorListsAndCards }\\n    = useQuery(getListsAndCards)\\n\\n  // A lot of data transformations and sub components.\\n  ...\\n\\n  // Display lists and cards.\\n  return (\\n    ...\\n  )\\n}\\n```\\nOnce you\'ve defined a query or action as described above, you can immediately import it into your client code as shown in the code sample, by using the `@wasp` prefix in the import path. `useQuery` ensures reactivity so once the data changes the query will get re-fetched. You can find more details about it [here](/docs/language/features#usequery).\\n\\nThis is pretty much it from the stuff that works \ud83d\ude04 ! I kinda rushed a bit through things here - for more details on all Wasp features and to build your first app with Wasp, check out our [docs](/docs/).\\n\\n## What doesn\'t work (yet)\\nThe main problem of the current implementation of Waspello is the **lack of support for optimistic UI updates in Wasp**. What this means is that currently, when an entity-related change is made (e.g. a card is moved from one list to another), we have to wait until that change is fully executed on the server until it is visible in the UI, which causes a noticeable delay.  \\nIn many cases that is not an issue, but when UI elements are all visible at once and it is expected from them to be updated immediately, then it is noticeable. This is also one of the main reasons why we chose to work on Waspello - to have a benchmark/sandbox for this feature! Due to this issue, here\'s how things currently look like:\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption alt=\\"Waspello - no optimistic UI update\\" source=\\"img/waspello-no-opt-UI-updates.gif\\" caption=\\"Without an optimistic UI update, there is a delay\\"/>\\n\\nYou can notice the delay between the moment the card is dropped on the \\"Done\\" list and the moment it becomes a part of that list. The reason is that at the moment of dropping the card on \\"Done\\" list, the API request with the change is sent to the server, and only when that change is fully processed on the server and saved to the database, the query `getListsAndCards` returns the correct info and consequently, UI is updated to the correct state.  \\nThat is why upon dropping on \\"Done\\", the card first goes back to the original list (because the change is not saved in db yet, so `useQuery(getListsAndCards)` still returns the \\"old\\" state), it waits a bit until the API request is processed successfully, and just then the change gets reflected in the UI.\\n\\n#### The solution\\nA typical approach for solving this issue is to **make the client a bit more self-confident, in a way that it doesn\'t wait for the confirmation from the server but rather immediately updates the UI, at the same time or even before the API request is fired**. If it then turns out something went wrong on the server (which typically shouldn\'t happen), it reverses the change and shows an error message.

We are currently in the \\"figuring out the solution\\" stage and you can [track/join the discussion on GitHub](https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/issues/63)!\\n\\n## What\'s missing (next features)\\nAlthough it looks super simple at the first glance, Trello is in fact a huge app with lots and lots of cool features hidden under the surface! Here are some of the more obvious ones that are currently not supported in Waspello:\\n- **Users can have multiple boards**, for different projects (currently we have no notion of a \\"Board\\" entity in Waspello at all, so there is implicitly only one)\\n- **Detailed card view** - when clicked on a card, a \\"full\\" view with extra options opens\\n- **Search** - user can search for a specific list/card\\n- **Collaboration** - multiple users can participate on the same board\\n\\nAnd many more - e.g. support for workspaces (next level of the hierarchy, a collection of boards), card labels, filters, ... . It is very helpful to have such a variety of features since we can use it as a testing ground for Wasp and use it as a guiding star towards Beta/1.0!\\n\\n## Become a Waspeller!\\n<p align=\\"center\\" >\\n  <figure style={{width: \'55%\'}}>\\n    <img alt=\\"Waspello propaganda\\"\\n        src={useBaseUrl(\'img/waspello-propaganda.png\')}\\n    />\\n    <figcaption class=\\"image-caption\\">Lightweight Waspello propaganda</figcaption>\\n  </figure>\\n</p>\\n\\n If you want to get involved with OSS and at the same time familiarize yourself with Wasp, this is a great way to get started - feel free to [choose one of the features listed here or add your own](https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/issues/337) and help us make Waspello the best demo productivity app out there!\\n\\nAlso, make sure to [join our community on Discord](https://discord.gg/rzdnErX).

Being based in the EU, we also didn\'t have a huge network in the Bay Area prior to the fundraise.\\n\\n:::caution\\nI will try to refrain from giving \\"general\\" advice (as our fundraise is a single data point), and focus on the stats and specific things that worked for us. Keep in mind the same might not work for you - I recommend always taking advice with a pinch of salt to see what makes the most sense in your case.\\n:::\\n\\nAs we approached our fundraise, we didn\'t really know what to expect. We had friends from the previous batch that raised a big round very quickly (even before Demo Day) and heard a couple of stories from a few other YC founders who were also quite successful, so we imagined it might go quickly for us too.\\n\\nAs you can see from the title, we had quite a journey with plenty of meetings that provided us a lot of input on how to improve our pitch, and maybe even more importantly, how to reach the right investors.\\n\\nHere are our stats:\\n- we spoke to **212 investors** \u2192 that led to **250+ meetings**\\n- **98 days** passed between the first and the last signed SAFE\\n- **171** investor passed, **24** never responded, **17** invested\\n\\nAnd here is how it all looked when laid out on a timeline:\\n![Wasp fundraise chart](../static/img/wasp-fundraise-chart.png)\\n\\nHere are some of the things that worked for us:\\n\\n## We treated fundraising as a sales process (and stuck to it)\\n![Wasp fundraise funnel](../static/img/wasp-fundraise-funnel.png)\\n\\nThis means we had a typical sales funnel - lead generation, selling (pitching) and following up:\\n- **Lead generation**: it started with Demo Day of course, from which we got 100+ leads but none of them ended up investing (more on that below). After that we mainly relied on our YC batchmates to identify relevant investors and get the intros.\\n- **Pitching**: we did a conversational pitch without the deck, but we had a Notion one-pager from which I would drop links during the conversation (to e.g. our traction chart, user testimonials etc.). It also worked well as investors would typically find it interesting and keep scrolling through as we talked, asking follow-up questions.\\n- **Following-up**: we followed up once per week. I would usually \\"batch process\\" it each Wednesday. We used Streak to identify all the leads that I haven\'t heard from in over 7 days (there is a filter for that) and then manually emailed them.\\n\\nWe started with tracking everything in Google Sheets, but with the volume of leads it soon became hard to navigate them through the funnel. Then we switched to Streak (used their fundraising template, and modified it a bit) and that worked great. The most helpful thing for me was having a CRM that is integrated with gmail, that made the process much more seamless and gave us better overview of the funnel. As soon as I would receive an email I could see in which stage the investor is, and it was also super easy to add new investors straight from gmail - it saved us from the dreaded context switching and kept us focused.\\n\\n## Our pitch became much better after ~50 meetings\\nWe kept being critical of our pitch and kept a list of questions that we felt needed more work. We called it \\"creating narratives\\", e.g. why the right time for our product is now, presenting the team, or how we plan to monetise. We talked to other companies in the same space (devtools, OSS), investigated comparatives (big companies we compared ourselves too), talked to our angels who were domain experts and used all that to build a more convincing story.\\n\\nI never intended to learn our pitch by heart, but after delivering it for 100s of times just that happened - both me and Martin (my brother and cofounder, who wasn\'t pitching but was always sitting behind me and provided feedback, especially in the beginning) knew it word by word and I realised how much more polished it sounds and how much more confident I felt compared to when we just started.\\n\\n## Our goal was to get to 100 no\'s\\nAfter about 50 meetings (and about 20 VCs having passed on us) we started feeling a bit disheartened, as things didn\'t seem to go so easy as we initially expected. Then I chatted to a friend who also recently finished their fundraise and he gave me a tour of Streak - I saw their numbers and that over 150 investors passed on them! With that I realised our 20 passes were just the beginning and that instead of chasing yeses we should actually chase no\'s :) - they are more predictable, you\'ll get plenty of them and they will clearly show your progress.\\n\\n## We had 100+ leads from Demo Day - none of them invested\\nThis is probably pretty specific for our case, but it\'s how it went. Connecting with a startup on Demo Day is a very low-cost action for investors. Also, as many investors as there are on Demo Day, there are even more of them who aren\'t.\\n\\nWhen we sorted through the connections we got, about 20% were a really good fit for us, meaning they invest in deep tech / OSS companies, have invested recently, invest in our stage etc.\\n\\nWe still met with pretty much all the interested leads, but we quickly realised that due to our product being deeply technical and the company being pre-revenue, only investors with engineering backgrounds were really interested because they could understand and get excited about what we do. That informed us to generate our leads with much narrower focus.\\n\\nWe looked at other OSS & dev tools companies in our batch, looked at who invested in them and asked for intros. Our batchmates were also in the fundraising mode, they knew how hard it can be and they wanted to help, so everything moved very quickly.\\n\\n## We learned not to spend time on non-believers\\nAs we learned to focus on the highly qualified leads, we also learned that it is very hard (impossible) to change somebody\'s mind. Plenty of investors liked u and what we do, but they were skeptical about e.g. market size or monetisation potential and made that clear from the start. Many of them were keen to keep chatting, wanted to meet our angel investors etc., but none of that helped change their mind and it was very distracting for us. I believe it is very hard to change somebody\'s worldview, especially in the seed stage when there is often no strong factual evidence to do so.\\n\\n## Passing through the \\"valley of death\\"\\nAs you can see on the chart, about two months in we barely passed $300k, and we had a whole month with no progress. At the same time, we felt that our pitch got significantly better and we were reaching investors much better suited for us. \\nIt was one of the most difficult times, seeing others close their rounds, but we decided to trust in the process and keep going until we have used all the resources we had. It was also the time our lead investor took time to do their own pretty extensive due diligence on Wasp, so although it looks like no progress was made from the outside, a lot of stuff was actually happening behind the scenes.\\n\\nSuddenly, a few things clicked together from multiple sides and our round was quickly closed, even oversubscribed! It was truly a magical feeling to start closing investors in a single day, even during the first call, when previously it took us weeks to close our first $50k check. The big factor was also that our round was getting filled up and that of course motivated investors to move faster.\\n\\n## We compared ourselves to big, successful companies\\nThis is one of the best pieces of advice we got from YC partners about fundraising. In the beginning we didn\'t understand how important this was, but once the meetings started we realised this was one of the best ways to explain the potential of our company to investors. With the innovation in technology that isn\'t easy to grasp, they needed something to hold on to understand how the business model and distribution could work, and it sounds much more doable if there is a playbook we can follow rather than us reinventing that as well. We kept working on finding a good comparable (we had a few) and explaining in which ways we are similar and why.\\n\\n## Good luck - you can do it!\\nI hope you found this helpful and that our story will motivate you to keep going once things get hard! We wish you the best of luck and also feel free to reach out if you\'ll have any questions.\\n\\n<InBlogCta />"},{"id":"/2021/11/21/seed-round","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2021/11/21/seed-round","editUrl":"https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/edit/main/web/blog/blog/2021-11-21-seed-round.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-11-21-seed-round.md","title":"Following YC, Wasp raised $1.5M Seed Round led by Lunar Ventures and HV Capital","description":"After graduating from Y Combinator\'s Winter 2021 Batch, we are super excited to announce that Wasp raised $1.5m in our first funding round!

Lima from Heller House\\n- Chris Schagen, former CMO on Contentful\\n- Rahul Thathoo, Sr. Eng. Manager at Square\\n- Preetha Parthasarathy\\n- John Kobs\\n\\n## Why did we raise funding?\\n\\nAt its core, Wasp is an open-source project and we have full intention for it to stay that way. Open-source is one of the most powerful ways to write software and we want to make sure Wasp is freely accessible to every developer.\\n\\nWasp is a technically innovative and challenging project. Even though we are not building a new general programming language from scratch, there still exists an essential complexity of building a language and all the tooling around it. Wasp offers a lot of abstractions that are being introduced for the first time and there is no clear blueprint to follow, and this is why such an undertaking requires full-time attention and dedication. Hence, we plan on expanding the team with some amazing engineers to accelerate us on our journey.\\n\\n## Where are we today?\\n\\nToday, Wasp is in Alpha. That means there are many features we still have to add and many that are probably going to change. But it also means you can [try it out, build a full-stack web app](/docs) and see what it is all about. You can also join [our community](https://discord.gg/rzdnErX) and share your feedback and experience with us - we\'d be happy to hear from you!\\n\\nSince we launched our Alpha several months ago, we got some amazing feedback on [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/wasp-lang-alpha) and [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26091956).\\n\\nWe\'ve also grown a lot and recently passed 1,000 stars on [our Github repo](https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp) - thank you!\\n\\n![Wasp GitHub Stars](../static/img/wasp-gh-stars-raise.png)\\n\\nTo date, over 250 projects have been created with Wasp in the last couple of months and some were even deployed to production - like [Farnance](https://farnance.netlify.app/) that ended up being a hackathon winner! Check out their source code [here](https://github.com/jlaneve/Farnance).\\n\\n![Farnance screenshot](../static/img/farnance-screenshot.png)\\n\\n## The team\\n\\nMartin and I have been working on Wasp for the last two years and together with our amazing contributors, who made us believe our vision is possible and made it what it is today. Having led development of several complex web apps in the past and continuously switching to the latest stack, we felt the pain and could also clearly see the patterns that we felt were mature and common enough to be worth extracting into a simpler, higher-level language.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n  <figure>\\n    <img alt=\\"The team\\"\\n        src={useBaseUrl(\'img/us-at-ycombinator.jpg\')}\\n    />\\n    <figcaption>Martin and I during our first YC interview.

There we first encountered the modern web stack and went on to lead development of web platforms in fintech and bioinformatics space. We also had a startup previously ([TalkBook](https://talkbook.co/home)), where we learned a lot about talking to users and building something that solves a problem they have.\\n\\n## What comes next?\\n\\nWith the funding secured, we can now fully focus on developing Wasp and the ecosystem around it. We can start planning for more [long-term features](https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/issues/109) that we couldn\'t fully commit to until now, and we can expand our team to move faster and bring more great people on board with new perspectives and enable them to fully employ their knowledge and creativity without any distractions.\\n\\nOur immediate focus is to bring Wasp to Beta and then 1.0 (see our high-level roadmap [here](https://wasp-lang.dev/#what-can-do)), while also building a strong foundation for our open source community. We believe community is the key to the success for Wasp and we will do everything in our power to make sure everybody feels welcome and has a fun and rewarding experience both building apps and contributing to the project. If you want to shape how millions of engineers develop the web apps of tomorrow, join our community and work with us!\\n\\nThank you for reading - we can\'t wait to see what you will build!\\n\\n<InBlogCta />"},{"id":"/2021/09/01/haskell-forall-tutorial","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2021/09/01/haskell-forall-tutorial","editUrl":"https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/edit/main/web/blog/blog/2021-09-01-haskell-forall-tutorial.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-09-01-haskell-forall-tutorial.md","title":"Tutorial: `forall` in Haskell","description":"--------","date":"2021-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"September 1, 2021","tags":[{"label":"haskell","permalink":"/blog/tags/haskell"},{"label":"tutorial","permalink":"/blog/tags/tutorial"}],"readingTime":8.775,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Martin Sosic","title":"Co-founder & CTO @ Wasp","url":"https://github.com/martinsos","imageURL":"https://github.com/martinsos.png","key":"martinsos"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Tutorial: `forall` in Haskell","authors":["martinsos"],"tags":["haskell","tutorial"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Following YC, Wasp raised $1.5M Seed Round led by Lunar Ventures and HV Capital","permalink":"/blog/2021/11/21/seed-round"},"nextItem":{"title":"How to implement a Discord bot (in NodeJS) that requires new members to introduce themselves","permalink":"/blog/2021/04/29/discord-bot-introduction"}},"content":"import useBaseUrl from \'@docusaurus/useBaseUrl\';\\n\\n--------\\n\\nFind out what Haskell\'s `forall` is all about.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nYou might have seen `forall` being used in Haskell like this:\\n```haskell\\nf :: forall a. [a] -> [a]\\nf xs = ys ++ ys\\n  where ys :: [a]\\n        ys = reverse xs\\n```\\nor\\n```hs\\nliftPair :: (forall x. x -> f x) -> (a, b) -> (f a, f b)\\n```\\nor\\n```hs\\ndata Showable = forall s. (Show s) => Showable s\\n```\\n\\n`forall` is something called \\"type quantifier\\", and it gives extra meaning to polymorphic type signatures (e.g. `:: a`, `:: a -> b`, `:: a -> Int`, ...).\\n\\nWhile normaly `forall` plays a role of the \\"universal quantifier\\", it can also play a role of the \\"existential quantifier\\" (depends on the situation).\\n\\nWhat does all this mean and how can `forall` be used in Haskell? Read on to find out!\\n\\nNOTE: we assume you are comfortable with basic polymorphism in Haskell.\\n\\n## Quick math/logic reminder\\n\\nIn mathematical logic, we have\\n\\n- **[universal quantifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_quantification)**\\n  - symbol: \u2200x\\n  - interpretation: \\"for all\\", \\"given any\\"\\n  - example: `\u2200x P(x)` means \\"for all x predicate P(x) is true\\".\\n- **[existential quantifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_quantification)**\\n  - symbol: \u2203x\\n  - interpretation: \\"there exists\\", \\"there is at least one\\", \\"for some\\"\\n  - example: `\u2203x P(x)` means \\"there is some x for which predicate P(x) is true\\".\\n\\n## Vanilla Haskell (no extensions)\\n\\nIn Haskell, all polymorphic type signatures are considered to be implicitly prefixed with `forall`.\\n\\nTherefore, if you have\\n```hs\\nf :: a -> a\\ng :: a -> (a -> b) -> b\\n```\\nit is really the same as\\n```hs\\nf :: forall a. a -> a\\ng :: forall a b. a -> (a -> b) -> b\\n```\\n\\nWhat `forall` here does is play the role of universal quantifier.\\nFor function `f`, it means it is saying \\"for all types, this function takes that type and returns the same type.\\".\\nOther way to put it would be \\"this funtion can be called with value of any type as its first argument, and it will return the value of that same type\\".\\n\\nSince `forall` is already implicit, writing it explicitly doesn\'t really do anything!\\n\\nNot only that, but without any extensions, you can\'t even write `forall` explicitly, you will get a syntax error, since `forall` is not a keyword in Haskell.\\n\\nSo what is the purpose of `forall` then? Well, obviously to be used with extensions :)!\\n\\nThe simplest extension is `ExplicitForAll`, which allows you to explicitly write `forall` (as we did above).\\nThis is not useful on its own though, since as we said above, explicitly writing `forall` doesn\'t change anything, it was already implicitly there.\\n\\nHowever, there are other extensions that make use of `forall` keyword, like: `ScopedTypeVariables`, `RankNTypes`, `ExistentialQuantification`.\\nAll these extensions automatically enable `ExplicitForAll` extension, which means you don\'t need to enable it yourself when using any of these.\\nThere is also `TypeApplications` extension which interacts with `forall` and in that case you might want to use `ExplicitForAll` with it.\\n\\nSince `forall` is useful only when used with extensions, let\'s take a look at how it is used in each one of those!\\n\\n## `forall` and extension [ScopedTypeVariables](https://ghc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/glasgow_exts.html#lexically-scoped-type-variables)\\n\\n`ScopedTypeVariables` enables lexical scoping of type variables by explicitly introducing them with `forall`.\\n\\nLet\'s take a look at the following example:\\n```hs\\nf :: [a] -> [a]\\nf xs = ys ++ ys\\n  where ys :: [a]\\n        ys = reverse xs\\n```\\n\\nThis code does not compile, because compiler can\'t match type of `ys` with the return type of `f`.\\nWhy though, when they are both `[a]`? Well, that is because that is not the same `a`!\\nTry changing `ys :: [a]` to `ys :: [b]` and you will get the exact same error,\\nbecause it is exactly the same code -> `a` in `ys :: [a]` and `a` in `f :: [a] -> [a]` are different `a`s and there is no connection between them.\\n`a` in `ys :: [a]` stands for \\"any type\\", not for \\"that type that is reffered to with `a` in the type signature above\\".\\n\\nThis is where `ScopedTypeVariables` comes in:\\n```hs\\n{-# LANGUAGE ScopedTypeVariables #-}\\n\\nf :: forall a. [a] -> [a]\\nf xs = ys ++ ys\\n  where ys :: [a]\\n        ys = reverse xs\\n```\\n\\n`forall` now gets special powers: the type variables bound by a forall (in our case `a`) scope over the entire definition\\nof the accompanying value declaration (in this case definition of `f`).\\n\\nThis means that any mention of type `a` in the definition of `f` now refers to that `a` from the type signature of `f`,\\nwhich is exactly what we needed, and the code example above now compiles.\\n\\n## `forall` and extension [RankNTypes](https://ghc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/glasgow_exts.html#arbitrary-rank-polymorphism)\\n\\nBasically, what `RankNTypes` does is enable you to use `forall` nested in type signatures, so that it does not apply to the whole type signature but just the part of it.\\n\\nThis enables some cool things that you were not able to do to before, for example you can specify that your function takes a polymorphic function as an argument.\\n\\nTake a look at this example:\\n```hs\\nfoo :: (forall a. a -> a) -> (Char, Bool)    -- We can do this only with RankNTypes.\\n\\nbar :: forall a. ((a -> a) -> (Char, Bool))  -- This is usual stuff, we don\'t need RankNTypes for it. Actually we can even drop `forall` since it is implicit.\\n```\\nIn `foo`, `forall` is applied only to the first argument of `foo`, which is `a -> a`, and not to the rest of the `f`\'s type signature. This can be done only with `RankNTypes` extension.\\n`bar` on the other hand has `forall` applied to the whole signature, and we could have even ommited this `forall` since it would be there implicitly anyway.\\n\\nNow, what does this mean? If we now have `specificFunc :: Int -> Int` and `polymorphicFunc :: a -> a`, `foo polymorphicFunc` will compile, while `foo specificFunc` will not! On the other hand both `bar specificFunc` and `bar polymorphicFunc` will compile.\\n\\nThis is because we specified, with `forall`, that `foo` needs a polymorphic function (function that takes value of **any** type and returns value of that same type) as the first argument, so we can\'t pass it a function like `specificFunc` that works only for `Int` -> such function is too specific.\\nOn the other hand, `bar` needs a function that takes value of **some** type and returns the value of that same type, so `specificFunc` is completely fine since it works only with `Int`, while `polymorphicFunc` is also ok although it is more general than what is needed, since compiler can easily specialize it. \\n\\nAnother example is `liftPair` function:\\n```hs\\nliftPair :: (forall x. x -> f x) -> (a, b) -> (f a, f b)\\nliftPair func (y, z) = (func y, func z)\\n```\\n```\\n>> liftPair (:[]) (1, \\"a\\")\\n([1], [\\"a\\"])\\n```\\n`liftPair` takes polymorphic function and applies it to both values in the pair.\\nThere would be no way to write its type signature without using `RankNTypes`.\\n\\n## `forall` and extension [ExistentialQuantification](https://ghc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/glasgow_exts.html#existentially-quantified-data-constructors)\\n\\n`ExistentialQuantification` enables us to use `forall` in the type signature of data constructors.\\n\\nThis is useful because it enables us to define heterogeneous data types, which then allows us to store different types in a single data collection (which normally you can\'t do in Haskell, e.g. you can\'t have different types in a list).\\n\\nFor example, if we have\\n```hs\\ndata Showable = forall s. (Show s) => Showable s\\n```\\nnow we can do\\n```hs\\nsomeShowables :: [Showable]\\nsomeShowables = [Showable \\"Hi\\", Showable 5, Showable (1, 2)]\\n\\nprintShowables :: [Showable] -> IO ()\\nprintShowables ss = mapM_ (\\\\(Showable s) -> print s) ss\\n\\nmain :: IO ()\\nmain = printShowables someShowables\\n```\\n\\nIn this example this allowed us to create a heterogeneous list, but only thing we can do with the contents of it is show them.\\n\\nWhat is interesting is that in this case, `forall` plays the role of an existential quantifier (therefore the name of extension, `ExistentialQuantification`), unlike the role of universal quantifier it normally plays.\\n\\n### GADTs\\n\\nAlternative approach to `ExistentialQuantification` is to use the `GADTs` extension, like this:\\n```hs\\n{-# LANGUAGE GADTs #-}\\ndata Showable where\\n  Showable :: (Show s) => s -> Showable\\n```\\n\\nIn this case `forall` is not needed, as it is implicit.\\n\\n\\n## `forall` and extension [TypeApplications](https://ghc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/glasgow_exts.html#visible-type-application)\\n\\n`TypeApplications` does not change how `forall` works like the extensions above do, but it does have an interesting interaction with `forall`, so we will mention it here.\\n\\n`TypeApplications` allows you to specify values of types variables in a type.\\n\\nFor example, you can do `show (read @Int \\"5\\")` to specify that `\\"5\\"` should be interpreted as an `Int`.\\n`read` has type signature `:: Read a => String -> a`, so what `@Int` does is say that that `a` in the type signature is `Int`.\\nTherefore, `read @Int :: String -> Int`.\\n\\nHow does `forall` come into play here?\\n\\nWell, if an identifier\u2019s type signature does not include an explicit `forall`, the type variable arguments appear in the left-to-right order in which the variables appear in the type. So, `foo :: Monad m => a b -> m (a c)` will have its type variables ordered as `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and type applications will happen in that order: if we have `foo @Maybe @Either`, `@Maybe` will apply to `m` while `@Either` will apply to `a`. However, if you want to force a different order, for example `a`, `b`, `c`, `m`, so that `@Maybe` in `foo @Maybe @Either` applies to `a`, you can refactor the signature as `foo :: forall a b c m. Monad m => a b -> m (a c)`, and now order of type variables in `forall` will be used when doing type applications!\\n\\nThis will require you to enable `ExplicitForAll` extension, if it is not already enabled.\\n\\n# Conclusion\\n\\nThis document should give a fair idea of how `forall` is used and what can be done with it, but it doesn\'t go into much depth or cover all of the ways `forall` is used in Haskell.\\n\\nFor more in-detail explanations and further investigation, here is a couple of useful resources:\\n- Great SO question/answers: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3071136/what-does-the-forall-keyword-in-haskell-ghc-do .\\n- Docs on extensions, which in details describe how each of them works: https://ghc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/glasgow_exts.html .\\n- https://ghc.gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/doc/users_guide/exts/explicit_forall.html .\\n- Article about `ST` monad that also explains a lot about `forall`: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/178243.178246 . \\n\\nThis blog post originated from the [notes I wrote in wasp-lang/haskell-handbook](https://github.com/wasp-lang/haskell-handbook/blob/35f14951b17f2174cbc269628bea157b6698a9e4/forall.md)."},{"id":"/2021/04/29/discord-bot-introduction","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2021/04/29/discord-bot-introduction","editUrl":"https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/edit/main/web/blog/blog/2021-04-29-discord-bot-introduction.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-04-29-discord-bot-introduction.md","title":"How to implement a Discord bot (in NodeJS) that requires new members to introduce themselves","description":"<img alt=\\"Guest introducing themselves and getting full-access.\\"","date":"2021-04-29T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"April 29, 2021","tags":[{"label":"discord","permalink":"/blog/tags/discord"},{"label":"nodejs","permalink":"/blog/tags/nodejs"}],"readingTime":8.87,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Martin Sosic","title":"Co-founder & CTO @ Wasp","url":"https://github.com/martinsos","imageURL":"https://github.com/martinsos.png","key":"martinsos"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"How to implement a Discord bot (in NodeJS) that requires new members to introduce themselves","authors":["martinsos"],"tags":["discord","nodejs"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Tutorial: `forall` in Haskell","permalink":"/blog/2021/09/01/haskell-forall-tutorial"},"nextItem":{"title":"Wasp - language for developing full-stack Javascript web apps with no boilerplate","permalink":"/blog/2021/03/02/wasp-alpha"}},"content":"import useBaseUrl from \'@docusaurus/useBaseUrl\';\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n  <figure>\\n    <img alt=\\"Guest introducing themselves and getting full-access.\\"\\n        src={useBaseUrl(\'img/discord-introduction-example.png\')}\\n    />\\n    <figcaption>A Guest user getting access by introducing themselves in the \\"introductions\\" channel.</figcaption>\\n  </figure>\\n</p>\\n\\nAt [Wasp](https://wasp-lang.dev), we have a Discord server for our community, where we talk with people interested in and using Wasp - Waspeteers!\\n\\nIn the beginning, we knew everybody in the community by their name, but as it started growing, we had a lot of people joining that never wrote anything, and the community started feeling less homey, less intimate.\\n\\nThis was when we decided to make it required for the new members to introduce themselves to gain access to the community.\\nWe knew that with this kind of barrier we would probably lose some potential new Waspeteers, but those that would go through it would be more engaged and better integrated.\\n\\nWe found no other way to accomplish this automatically but to implement our own Discord bot.\\nIn this post I will describe in detail how we did it.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## High-level approach\\n\\nWe want the following: when a new user comes to our Discord server, they should be able to access only \\"public\\" channels, like `rules`, `contributing`, and most importantly, `introductions`, where they could introduce themselves.\\n\\nOnce they introduced themselves in the `introductions` channel, they would get access to the rest of the channels.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n  <figure>\\n    <img alt=\\"Channels user can see when Guest vs when full member.\\"\\n        src={useBaseUrl(\'img/wasp-guest-vs-waspeteer.png\')}\\n        height=\\"400px\\"\\n    />\\n    <figcaption>Left: what Guest sees; Right: what Waspeteer sees.</figcaption>\\n  </figure>\\n</p>\\n\\n\\nIn Discord, access control is performed via roles. There are two ways to accomplish what we need:\\n1. **Adding a role that grants access**. When they join, they have no roles. Once they introduce themselves, they are granted a role (e.g. `Member` or `Waspeteer`) that is required to access the rest of the server.\\n2. **Removing a role that forbids access**. When they join, they are automatically assigned a role `Guest`, for which we configured the non-public channels to deny access. Once they introduce themselves, the role `Guest` gets removed and they gain access to the rest of the server.\\n\\nWe decided to go with the second approach since it means we don\'t have to assign all the existing members with a new role. From now on, we will be talking about how to get this second approach working.\\n\\nTo get this going, we need to do the following:\\n1. Create role `Guest`.\\n2. Ensure that the `Guest` role has permissions to access only \\"public\\" channels.\\n   One convenient way to go about this is to disable \\"View Channels\\" permission for the role `Guest` at the level of Category, so it propagates to all the channels in it, instead of doing it for every single channel.\\n   Once you are done, use the \\"See server as a role\\" feature of Discord to confirm that you set the permissions as you wanted.\\n3. Automatically inform new members that they must introduce themselves in the `introductions` channel with `!intro <text_about_me>` to gain access to the rest of the server.\\n   This can be done via Discord\'s \\"Welcome Screen\\" feature or via one of the many existing Discord bots out there offering this functionality.\\n4. Automatically assign the `Guest` role to a new member when they join the server.\\n5. Automatically remove the `Guest` role when a member introduces themselves in the public `introductions` channel.\\n\\n#1, #2 and #3 are relatively straight-forward.\\n\\nFor the #4 (automatic assignment of the role when a new member joins the server), since Discord doesn\'t support this directly, you will need a bot to do it.\\nLuckily, many bots allow you to auto-assign roles when new members join, and I ended up using [MEE6](https://mee6.xyz/) for this.\\nI set it up so that when a new member joins, they are immediately assigned a `Guest` role.\\n\\nHowever, for the #5 (remove or assign the role on a message in a specific channel), the situation is more complicated - I couldn\'t find a single bot out there that supports this!\\nThe closest I got was with [Carl Bot](https://carl.gg/) and its \\"tags\\" feature, which allows you to write custom code, but in the end, it turned out to be too restrictive to accomplish this.\\nTherefore, I ended up implementing our own bot (Wasp Bot) that does this.\\n\\n## Implementing a Discord Bot (NodeJS)\\n\\nI decided to implement a bot in NodeJS since it is easy to get started quickly and there is a good Discord library.\\n\\nI will describe how to create it step by step below, but [here is the final code of the bot](https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp-bot/tree/4b3858202622c7635aeb6f1d71d9ba9781eea6eb) if you want to skip ahead.\\n\\n### Defining bot on Discord and adding it to your server.\\n\\nBefore we even start implementing the bot, we will tell Discord about it first, in order to obtain the neccessary credentials that we will use in our code, and we will add the bot to our server.\\nThere are many tutorials already on how to do this, so I will keep it short.\\n\\n1. Go to Discord Developer Portal, create a new Application -> I named it `Wasp`.\\n2. Go to the \\"Bot\\" part of Application \\"Settings\\" and add a new bot. I named it `WaspBot`.\\n3. On the \\"Bot\\" page of your freshly created bot, there is a \\"TOKEN\\" part -> create a mental note about it, we will need this later when running our bot.\\n4. Go to the \\"OAuth2\\" part of Application \\"Settings\\". Here we will define which permissions our bot will have.\\n   This is done by checking the permissions we want to give it and then following the URL that will be generated based on our choices.\\n   - Check the `bot` under the \\"SCOPES\\" section.\\n   - Scroll down further to find the \\"BOT PERMISSIONS\\" section. There, check the `Manage Roles`, `View Channels`, `Read Message History`, and `Send Messages`.\\n   - Under the \\"SCOPES\\" section above, you will see a URL. Copy it into the browser and follow the steps to add the bot to your server.\\n\\n### Creating a basic bot in NodeJS\\n\\nIn a directory where your code will be, create a new npm project with `npm init` -> set the entry point to `bot.js` instead of `index.js`. This will result in a `package.json` file being generated.\\n\\nWe will need one important dependency, `discord.js`, to make it easy to work with Discord\'s API.\\nAdd it with `npm install -S discord.js`.\\n\\nNow, create `bot.js` file next to `package.json` with following content:\\n```js title=\\"bot.js\\"\\nconst Discord = require(\'discord.js\')\\n\\nconst BOT_TOKEN = process.env.BOT_TOKEN\\n\\nconst bot = new Discord.Client()\\nbot.login(BOT_TOKEN)\\n\\nbot.on(\'ready\', function (evt) {\\n  console.log(`Logged in as: ${bot.user.tag}.`)\\n})\\n```\\n\\nThis is it! Run\\n```\\nDISCORD_BOT=<TOKEN_OF_YOUR_DISCORD_BOT> node bot.js\\n```\\nand you should see output about successful login, in my case it was `Logged in as: WaspBot#1234`.\\n\\n### Detecting a valid introduction from a member\\n\\n**NOTE**: For the following part, I was using [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/) docs to figure out how to do it, so if you need more details on a specific step, check them out.\\n\\nNow is the moment to define exactly how we want the introduction process to go.\\nSo, let\'s say that the correct way for new members to introduce themselves is by sending a message to the `introductions` channel that starts with `!intro ` and follows with at least 20 characters of text (to ensure the introduction is not too short).\\n`!intro` makes it easy for our bot to know when to act (in Discord, bot commands often start with `!<something>`).\\n\\nLet\'s add the needed code to `bot.js`:\\n```js title=\\"bot.js\\"\\n...\\n\\nconst INTRODUCTIONS_CHANNEL_ID = \\"<YOU_WILL_HAVE_TO_FIND_THIS_ON_DISCORD_SERVER>\\"\\n\\nbot.on(\'message\', async msg => {\\n  if (msg.content.startsWith(\'!intro \')) {\\n    if (msg.channel.id.toString() !== INTRODUCTIONS_CHANNEL_ID) {\\n      const introductionsChannelName =\\n        msg.guild.channels.resolve(INTRODUCTIONS_CHANNEL_ID).name\\n      return msg.reply(\\n        `Please use !intro command in the ${introductionsChannelName} channel!`\\n      )\\n    }\\n\\n    const introMsg = msg.content.substring(\'!intro \'.length).trim()\\n    const minMsgLength = 20\\n    if (introMsg.length < minMsgLength) {\\n      return msg.reply(\\n        `Please write introduction at least ${minMsgLength} characters long!`\\n      )\\n    }\\n\\n    return msg.reply(`Yay successful introduction!`)\\n  }\\n})\\n```\\n\\nOne thing to notice is that you will have to obtain the ID of the `introductions` channel and paste it in your code where I put the placeholder above.\\nYou can find out this ID by going to your Discord server in the Discord app, right-clicking on the `introductions` channel, and clicking on `Copy ID`. For this to work, you will first have to enable the \\"Developer Mode\\" (under \\"User Settings\\" > \\"Advanced\\").\\n\\n### Removing the \\"Guest\\" role upon successful introduction\\n\\nWhat is missing is removing the `Guest` role upon successful introduction, so let\'s do that:\\n\\n```js {4,24-35} title=\\"bot.js\\"\\n...\\n\\nconst INTRODUCTIONS_CHANNEL_ID = \\"<YOU_WILL_HAVE_TO_FIND_THIS_ON_DISCORD_SERVER>\\"\\nconst GUEST_ROLE_ID = \\"<YOU_WILL_HAVE_TO_FIND_THIS_ON_DISCORD_SERVER>\\"\\n\\nbot.on(\'message\', async msg => {\\n  if (msg.content.startsWith(\'!intro \')) {\\n    if (msg.channel.id.toString() !== INTRODUCTIONS_CHANNEL_ID) {\\n      const introductionsChannelName =\\n        msg.guild.channels.resolve(INTRODUCTIONS_CHANNEL_ID).name\\n      return msg.reply(\\n      `Please use !intro command in the ${introductionsChannelName} channel!`\\n      )\\n    }\\n\\n    const introMsg = msg.content.substring(\'!intro \'.length).trim()\\n    const minMsgLength = 20\\n    if (introMsg.length < minMsgLength) {\\n      return msg.reply(\\n        `Please write introduction at least ${minMsgLength} characters long!`\\n      )\\n    }\\n\\n    const member = msg.guild.member(msg.author)\\n    try {\\n      if (member.roles.cache.get(GUEST_ROLE_ID)) {\\n        await member.roles.remove(GUEST_ROLE_ID)\\n        return msg.reply(\\n          \'Nice getting to know you! You are no longer a guest\' +\\n          \' and have full access, welcome!\'\\n        )\\n      }\\n    } catch (error) {\\n      return msg.reply(`Error: ${error}`)\\n    }\\n  }\\n})\\n```\\n\\nSame as with the ID of the `introductions` channel, now you will also need to find out the ID of the `Guest` role (which you should have created at some point).\\nYou can do it by finding it in the server settings, under the list of roles, right-clicking on it, and then \\"Copy ID\\".\\n\\nThis is it! You can now run the bot with\\n```js\\nDISCORD_BOT=<TOKEN_OF_YOUR_DISCORD_BOT> node bot.js\\n```\\nand if you assign yourself a `Guest` role on the Discord server and then type `!intro Hi this is my introduction, I am happy to be here.` in the `introductions` channel, you should see yourself getting full access together with an appropriate message from your bot.\\n\\n### Deploying the bot\\n\\n:::note\\nHeroku used to offer free apps under certain limits. However, as of November 28, 2022, they ended support for their free tier. https://blog.heroku.com/next-chapter\\n\\nAs such, we have updated our Deployment docs with new recommendations: https://wasp-lang.dev/docs/deploying\\n:::\\n\\nWhile there are many ways to deploy the Discord bot, I will shortly describe how we did it via Heroku.\\n\\nWe created a Heroku app `wasp-discord-bot` and set up the \\"Automatic deploys\\" feature on Heroku to automatically deploy every push to the `production` branch (our bot is on Github).\\n\\nOn Heroku, we set the environment variable `DISCORD_BOT` to the token of our bot.\\n\\nFinally, we added `Procfile` to our project:\\n```yaml title=\\"Procfile\\"\\nworker: node bot.js\\n```\\n\\nThat is it! On every push to the `production` branch, our bot gets deployed."},{"id":"/2021/03/02/wasp-alpha","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2021/03/02/wasp-alpha","editUrl":"https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/edit/main/web/blog/blog/2021-03-02-wasp-alpha.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-03-02-wasp-alpha.md","title":"Wasp -

responsive UI, proper error handling, security, building, deployment, authentication, managing server state on the client, managing database, different environments, ....\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n  <img alt=\\"Iceberg of web app development\\"\\n      src={useBaseUrl(\'img/iceberg-of-web-app-dev.png\')}\\n      width=\\"500px\\"\\n  />\\n</p>\\n\\nJose Aguinaga described in a fun way the unexpected complexity of web app development in his blog post [\\"How it feels to learn JavaScript in 2016\\"](https://hackernoon.com/how-it-feels-to-learn-javascript-in-2016-d3a717dd577f), which still feels relevant 4 years later. \\n\\nWe are building Wasp because even though we are both experienced developers and have worked on multiple complex web apps in various technologies (JQuery -> Backbone -> Angular -> React, own scripts / makefile -> Grunt -> Gulp -> Webpack, PHP -> Java -> Node.js, \u2026), we still feel **building web apps is harder than it should be**, due to a lot of boilerplate and repetitive work involved in the process.  \\n\\nThe main insight for us was that while the tech stack keeps advancing rapidly, the core requirements of the apps are mostly remaining the same (auth, routing, data model CRUD, ACL, \u2026).\\n\\nThat is why almost 2 years ago we started thinking about **separating web app specification** (what it should do) **from its implementation** (how it should do it).  \\nThis led us to the idea of extracting common web app features and concepts into a special specification language (Wasp), while the implementation details are still described via a modern stack (right now React, Node.js, Prisma).\\n\\nOur vision with Wasp is to create **a powerful but simple language where you can describe your web app as humanly as possible**.\\nWe want to make the top of that iceberg on the image above as pleasant as possible while making the bottom part much smaller.  \\nIn such language, with just a few words, you can specify pages and their routes, specify which type of authentication you want, define basic entities / data models, describe basic data flow, choose where you want to deploy, implement specific details in React/Node, and let Wasp take care of connecting it all, building it and deploying it.\\n\\n```css title=\\"Example of wasp code describing part of a simple full-stack web app.\\"\\napp todoApp {\\n  title: \\"ToDo App\\" /* visible in tab */\\n}\\n\\nroute \\"/\\" -> page Main\\npage Main {\\n  component: import Main from \\"@ext/Main.js\\"  /* Import your React code. */\\n}\\n\\nauth { /* full-stack auth out-of-the-box */\\n  userEntity: User,\\n  methods: {\\n    usernameAndPassword: {}\\n  }\\n}\\n\\nentity User {=psl\\n  id          Int     @id @default(autoincrement())\\n  username    String  @unique\\n  password    String\\npsl=}\\n```\\n\\nCheck [here](https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/blob/release/examples/tutorials/TodoApp/main.wasp) for the complete example.\\n\\n## Why a language (DSL), aren\u2019t frameworks solving this already?\\n\\nFrameworks (like e.g. Ruby on Rails or Meteor) are a big inspiration to us.\\nHowever, we want to take things one step further - by designing a language specialized for the domain of web apps (a [DSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language)) we can get rid of a lot of boilerplate and provide a cleaner & simpler developer experience.\\n\\nOn the other hand, we are not trying to replace everything with Wasp nor think that would make sense - just the opposite, Wasp acts as a \u201cglue\u201d between your React and Node.js code, saving you from the grunt work while allowing you to keep the flexibility of writing your own code.\\n**The majority of the code is still being written in React and Node.js, with Wasp serving as the backbone of your whole application.**\\n\\nAnother benefit of a DSL is that it allows Wasp to **understand the web app\u2019s requirements during the build time and reason about it** before generating the final code, and this is what we are especially excited about.\\n\\nFor example, when generating code to be deployed to production, it could pick the most appropriate architecture based on its understanding of the web app and deploy it to serverless or another type of architecture (or even a combination).\\nAnother example would be reusing your data model logic through all the parts of the stack while defining it just once in Wasp.\\n\\nDSL opens the potential for optimizations, static analysis, extensibility, and unparalleled ergonomics.\\n\\n## How does it work?\\n\\nWasp compiler compiles the .wasp/React/Node.js source code into just React/Node.js target code.  \\nCurrently, Wasp supports only Javascript, but we plan to add Typescript soon.  \\nTechnical note: Wasp compiler is implemented in Haskell.\\n\\n![Wasp compilation diagram](/img/wasp-compilation.png)\\n\\nWhile right now only React and Node.js are supported, we plan to support multiple other technologies in the future.\\n\\nGenerated code is human readable and can easily be inspected and even ejected if Wasp becomes too limiting.\\nIf not ejecting, there is no need for you to ever look at the generated code - it is generated by Wasp in the background.\\n\\nWasp is used via `wasp` CLI - to run wasp project in development, all you need to do is run `wasp start`.\\n\\n<p align=\\"center\\">\\n  <img alt=\\"Wasp CLI output\\"\\n      src={useBaseUrl(\'img/wasp-cli-output.png\')}\\n  />\\n</p>\\n\\n\\n## Where is Wasp now and where is it going?\\n\\nOur big vision is to move as much of the web app domain knowledge as possible into the Wasp language itself, giving Wasp more power and flexibility.\\n\\nUltimately, since Wasp would have such a deep understanding of the web app\'s requirements, we could generate a visual editor on top of it - allowing non-developers to participate in development alongside developers.\\n\\nAlso, Wasp wouldn\'t be tied to the specific technology but rather support multiple technologies (React/Angular/..., Node/Go/...**.\\n\\n**Wasp is currently in Alpha** and some features are still rough or missing, there are things we haven\u2019t solved yet and others that will probably change as we progress, but **you can try it out and build and deploy web apps**!\\n\\n### What Wasp currently supports:\\n - \u2705 full-stack auth (username & password)\\n - \u2705 pages & routing\\n - \u2705 blurs the line between client & server - define your server actions and queries and call them directly in your client code (RPC)!\\n - \u2705 smart caching of server actions and queries (automatic cache invalidation)\\n - \u2705 entity (data model) definition with Prisma.io\\n - \u2705 ACL on frontend\\n - \u2705 importing NPM dependencies \\n\\n### What is coming:\\n - \u23f3 ACL on backend\\n - \u23f3 one-click deployment\\n - \u23f3 more auth methods (Google, Linkedin, ...**\\n - \u23f3 tighter integration of entities with other features\\n - \u23f3 themes and layouts\\n - \u23f3 support for explicitly defined server API\\n - \u23f3 inline JS - the ability to mix JS code with Wasp code!\\n - \u23f3 Typescript support\\n - \u23f3 server-side rendering\\n - \u23f3 Visual Editor\\n - \u23f3 support for different languages on the backend\\n - \u23f3 richer wasp language with better tooling \\n\\n**You can check out our repo** at https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp and **give it a try** at https://wasp-lang.dev/docs -> we are always looking for feedback and suggestions on how to shape Wasp!\\n\\nWe also have a **community** on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/rzdnErX), where we chat about Wasp-related stuff -

language that removes boilerplate and makes web development simpler.\\nWe named it Wasp (Web App SPecification).\\n\\nAfter working on it for about a year as a side-project (researching the space, talking with potential users, building a prototype, learning), we realized it will take our full-time dedication to make something serious out of it, so we quit the current job and went all-in into Wasp, bootstrapping ourselves while working on it, to see how far we can get.\\n\\n## The journey to YCombinator\\n\\nDue to the nature of Wasp (open-source, web framework / language), we were aware that we will need to raise funds at some point if we want to survive.\\nWe had a startup of our own previously, and we worked in multiple startups in the past, so we already knew quite a bit about how to go about it and what to expect.\\n\\nTherefore, as soon as we went full-time into it (start of 2020), we immediately applied for YCombinator (top startup accelerator in the world). Soon, we got invited to the USA (we are from Europe) for the final on-site interview!\\n\\nWe spent weeks preparing for the interview, polishing our pitch, vision, business plan, our understanding of our users, doing mock interviews - all for those crucial 10 minutes (yes, interview lasts only 10 minutes!).\\nAt the end we didn\u2019t pass the final interview, however we got encouraging feedback that, although we are too early, we have potential and should try applying again when we make more progress.\\nThis made a lot of sense to us, since we had only a very basic prototype and little traction.\\n\\nWe decided to continue working on Wasp for some longer time and continue applying to YC and talking with other interesting accelerators/investors, and see where that gets us - if nothing else, we will learn a lot on the way :)!\\n\\nHalf a year later, after making progress on multiple sides, we went for a second interview (this time online due to Covid) and while we felt it was really close, we still didn\u2019t get in - they wanted to see more traction, more proof that people want it.\\n\\nFinally, by the autumn of 2020, we were in a position where we had released an early-alpha version of Wasp, managed to build an initial community (>50 people on Discord, 500 Github stars) and made it to \u201cProduct of the day\u201d on the Product Hunt.\\nWith all that we applied for the YC for the third time and made it in!\\n\\nInteresting fact is that if you applied to YC previously and got rejected, that is actually a plus when you apply the next time (it show persistence, and they can see your progress).\\nAlso, while we did spend significant time preparing for the YC interviews, all that preparation also helped us get a better understanding of our idea, what our users(developers) really need and how to properly present it, so it was worth it regardless of the result of the interviews.\\n\\n## What now?\\n\\nRight now (Feb 2020) we are in the middle of the YCombinator program, building community, talking with developers and developing Wasp toward beta.\\n\\nIt is still just the two of us and Wasp is in early stage, but with amazing community members on our side and with YC backing us up, we are not afraid to dream big!"},{"id":"/2019/09/01/hello-wasp","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2019/09/01/hello-wasp","editUrl":"https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/edit/main/web/blog/blog/2019-09-01-hello-wasp.md","source":"@site/blog/2019-09-01-hello-wasp.md","title":"Hello Wasp!","description":"About a year or so ago, brother and I started discussing how awesome it would be to have a programming language that would understand what \u201cweb app\u201d means.

While still very early, we are writing this blog post to explain why are we building Wasp, what is the current status and what the future may hold.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## More specification, less implementation\\n\\nImagine you want to create a simple Todo web app.\\n\\nYou would explain it like this to your best buddy web developer: \u201cI want to create a web app with the title \u2018Todo App\u2019 that has a single page with a list of tasks. Each task has a description and can be either marked as done or not done. The list starts as empty and tasks can be added, deleted or marked as done. I will send you designs for this. Also, I want a user to be required to register/log in.\u201d\\n\\nNow, let\u2019s take a look at what needs to be done to implement such an app. We need to choose technologies we are going to use (frontend, backend, database, \u2026), figure out the project file structure, set up the build toolchain, configure linting/auto-formatting/style-guide, set up tests (unit/integration, e2e), set up deployment (production, staging), set up code sharing between frontend and backend, \u2026 . Then, once everything is set up, we need to implement basic CRUD functionality (components on frontend and API on the backend), user management, probably some kind of menu on the frontend, \u2026\\n\\nWe can easily see that explanation to web developer (specification) is short and concise because many details are implicit or assumed to be handled in a reasonable default way. On the other hand, implementation is complicated since it has to take care of all the details, many of them not unique for the web app we are building but common for most of the web apps. Also, if we consider the specification through time, it would look the same now and 5 years ago. On the other hand, implementation would be different, due to the new technologies that have emerged in the meantime.\\n\\nSo if the specification is time-resilient, short and relatively simple to describe, while implementation is complex, volatile and requires a lot of expert knowledge, how great would it be to write more of specification and less of implementation when building a web app? For that, we need more powerful languages, that will be able to express more in less code. This is where Wasp comes in.\\n\\n## Wasp!\\n\\nThe idea behind Wasp is to take everything repetitive and common in the development of a typical web app and have Wasp take care of those parts for us. Ideally, programming in Wasp would very much look like describing the specification to the web developer, therefore writing more specification and less implementation. Wasp is the one who will keep evolving and making sure your specification is implemented in the best possible technology using the industry best practices.\\n\\nTo achieve that, we made Wasp as a DSL (domain-specific language) that understands common concepts of a web app like pages, routes, frontend and backend and their relationship, entities, user and roles/permissions, etc. Other parts, those that are specific for our web app (business logic), we can still write in html/css/js/\u2026, and then plug them into Wasp, combining the power of Wasp with the flexibility of existing technologies.\\n\\n## What\u2019s up?\\n\\nWe are currently working on the first version of Wasp compiler, and are planning to soon have very first, MVP version ready. It will be just the first step of our vision of what Wasp could be, but the sooner we get it out there, the sooner we can start collecting feedback and further shaping Wasp together with the community.\\n\\nWe believe it will take significant effort to bring Wasp to the level where a big portion of developers will be able to build the whole app with Wasp without feeling restrained by missing flexibility or options, while on the other hand, we don\u2019t want to wait too long until people can start using Wasp. Therefore, we decided to build it from start in such a way that a developer can at any moment \u201ceject\u201d from Wasp and continue on their own, where \u201cejecting\u201d would mean that Wasp would generate the source code of web app that you can continue working on. That is why compiler for Wasp that we are building is actually a transpiler whose output is web app written with best practices, that you can at any moment take and continue from there if you feel too limited by Wasp. It is like having a senior developer guide you through writing a web app!\\n\\nThis poses the following question: \u201cIn which technologies will web app that Wasp transpiler produces be implemented?\u201d. Well, while our vision is to offer multiple flavors here, so that you can choose the combination of technologies that you want to use, for a start we are going with one fixed technology stack, based on most popular technologies: React, Redux, NodeJS, and Mongo.\\n\\n## Moar\\n\\nOne thing that we are very excited about regarding Wasp is that Wasp understands the way web app is built. So, once you describe it in Wasp, there are many things we could be able to do with it. We could automatically generate tests since we understand the requirements. We could suggest solutions on how to improve the design of the web app. Also, since Wasp should make building web apps easier, we could build solutions on top of it, for example, a visual builder that generates Wasp code, that in turn generates a web app.\\n\\nWe are still very early in the Wasp journey but we are very excited about the opportunities that we imagine it could bring and about the possibilities it could unlock. We hope that this blog post will inspire others to discuss this concept and that together we will create something amazing and learn a lot on the way!"}]}')}}]);
