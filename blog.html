We had friends from the previous batch that raised a big round very quickly (even before Demo Day) and heard a couple of stories from a few other YC founders who were also quite successful, so we imagined it might go quickly for us too.</p><p>As you can see from the title, we had quite a journey with plenty of meetings that provided us a lot of input on how to improve our pitch, and maybe even more importantly, how to reach the right investors.</p><p>Here are our stats:</p><ul><li>we spoke to <strong>212 investors</strong> → that led to <strong>250+ meetings</strong></li><li><strong>98 days</strong> passed between the first and the last signed SAFE</li><li><strong>171</strong> investor passed, <strong>24</strong> never responded, <strong>17</strong> invested</li></ul><p>And here is how it all looked when laid out on a timeline:
<img alt="Wasp fundraise chart" src="/wasp/assets/images/wasp-fundraise-chart-a33933a8d730d069466d786cdd899558.png"></p><p>Here are some of the things that worked for us:</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="we-treated-fundraising-as-a-sales-process-and-stuck-to-it"></a>We treated fundraising as a sales process (and stuck to it)<a class="hash-link" href="#we-treated-fundraising-as-a-sales-process-and-stuck-to-it" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><img alt="Wasp fundraise funnel" src="/wasp/assets/images/wasp-fundraise-funnel-bbf1b2a80cd7af81c9e3c6790b4a0541.png"></p><p>This means we had a typical sales funnel - lead generation, selling (pitching) and following up:</p><ul><li><strong>Lead generation</strong>: it started with Demo Day of course, from which we got 100+ leads but none of them ended up investing (more on that below). After that we mainly relied on our YC batchmates to identify relevant investors and get the intros.</li><li><strong>Pitching</strong>: we did a conversational pitch without the deck, but we had a Notion one-pager from which I would drop links during the conversation (to e.g. our traction chart, user testimonials etc.). It also worked well as investors would typically find it interesting and keep scrolling through as we talked, asking follow-up questions.</li><li><strong>Following-up</strong>: we followed up once per week. I would usually &quot;batch process&quot; it each Wednesday. We used Streak to identify all the leads that I haven&#x27;t heard from in over 7 days (there is a filter for that) and then manually emailed them.</li></ul><p>We started with tracking everything in Google Sheets, but with the volume of leads it soon became hard to navigate them through the funnel. Then we switched to Streak (used their fundraising template, and modified it a bit) and that worked great. The most helpful thing for me was having a CRM that is integrated with gmail, that made the process much more seamless and gave us better overview of the funnel. As soon as I would receive an email I could see in which stage the investor is, and it was also super easy to add new investors straight from gmail - it saved us from the dreaded context switching and kept us focused.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="our-pitch-became-much-better-after-50-meetings"></a>Our pitch became much better after ~50 meetings<a class="hash-link" href="#our-pitch-became-much-better-after-50-meetings" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>We kept being critical of our pitch and kept a list of questions that we felt needed more work. We called it &quot;creating narratives&quot;, e.g. why the right time for our product is now, presenting the team, or how we plan to monetise. We talked to other companies in the same space (devtools, OSS), investigated comparatives (big companies we compared ourselves too), talked to our angels who were domain experts and used all that to build a more convincing story.</p><p>I never intended to learn our pitch by heart, but after delivering it for 100s of times just that happened - both me and Martin (my brother and cofounder, who wasn&#x27;t pitching but was always sitting behind me and provided feedback, especially in the beginning) knew it word by word and I realised how much more polished it sounds and how much more confident I felt compared to when we just started.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="our-goal-was-to-get-to-100-nos"></a>Our goal was to get to 100 no&#x27;s<a class="hash-link" href="#our-goal-was-to-get-to-100-nos" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>After about 50 meetings (and about 20 VCs having passed on us) we started feeling a bit disheartened, as things didn&#x27;t seem to go so easy as we initially expected. Then I chatted to a friend who also recently finished their fundraise and he gave me a tour of Streak - I saw their numbers and that over 150 investors passed on them! With that I realised our 20 passes were just the beginning and that instead of chasing yeses we should actually chase no&#x27;s :) - they are more predictable, you&#x27;ll get plenty of them and they will clearly show your progress.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="we-had-100-leads-from-demo-day---none-of-them-invested"></a>We had 100+ leads from Demo Day - none of them invested<a class="hash-link" href="#we-had-100-leads-from-demo-day---none-of-them-invested" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>This is probably pretty specific for our case, but it&#x27;s how it went. Connecting with a startup on Demo Day is a very low-cost action for investors. Also, as many investors as there are on Demo Day, there are even more of them who aren&#x27;t.</p><p>When we sorted through the connections we got, about 20% were a really good fit for us, meaning they invest in deep tech / OSS companies, have invested recently, invest in our stage etc.</p><p>We still met with pretty much all the interested leads, but we quickly realised that due to our product being deeply technical and the company being pre-revenue, only investors with engineering backgrounds were really interested because they could understand and get excited about what we do. That informed us to generate our leads with much narrower focus.</p><p>We looked at other OSS &amp; dev tools companies in our batch, looked at who invested in them and asked for intros. Our batchmates were also in the fundraising mode, they knew how hard it can be and they wanted to help, so everything moved very quickly.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="we-learned-not-to-spend-time-on-non-believers"></a>We learned not to spend time on non-believers<a class="hash-link" href="#we-learned-not-to-spend-time-on-non-believers" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>As we learned to focus on the highly qualified leads, we also learned that it is very hard (impossible) to change somebody&#x27;s mind. Plenty of investors liked u and what we do, but they were skeptical about e.g. market size or monetisation potential and made that clear from the start. Many of them were keen to keep chatting, wanted to meet our angel investors etc., but none of that helped change their mind and it was very distracting for us. I believe it is very hard to change somebody&#x27;s worldview, especially in the seed stage when there is often no strong factual evidence to do so.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="passing-through-the-valley-of-death"></a>Passing through the &quot;valley of death&quot;<a class="hash-link" href="#passing-through-the-valley-of-death" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>As you can see on the chart, about two months in we barely passed $300k, and we had a whole month with no progress. At the same time, we felt that our pitch got significantly better and we were reaching investors much better suited for us.
It was one of the most difficult times, seeing others close their rounds, but we decided to trust in the process and keep going until we have used all the resources we had. It was also the time our lead investor took time to do their own pretty extensive due diligence on Wasp, so although it looks like no progress was made from the outside, a lot of stuff was actually happening behind the scenes.</p><p>Suddenly, a few things clicked together from multiple sides and our round was quickly closed, even oversubscribed! It was truly a magical feeling to start closing investors in a single day, even during the first call, when previously it took us weeks to close our first $50k check. The big factor was also that our round was getting filled up and that of course motivated investors to move faster.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="we-compared-ourselves-to-big-successful-companies"></a>We compared ourselves to big, successful companies<a class="hash-link" href="#we-compared-ourselves-to-big-successful-companies" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>This is one of the best pieces of advice we got from YC partners about fundraising. In the beginning we didn&#x27;t understand how important this was, but once the meetings started we realised this was one of the best ways to explain the potential of our company to investors. With the innovation in technology that isn&#x27;t easy to grasp, they needed something to hold on to understand how the business model and distribution could work, and it sounds much more doable if there is a playbook we can follow rather than us reinventing that as well. We kept working on finding a good comparable (we had a few) and explaining in which ways we are similar and why.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="good-luck---you-can-do-it"></a>Good luck - you can do it!<a class="hash-link" href="#good-luck---you-can-do-it" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>I hope you found this helpful and that our story will motivate you to keep going once things get hard!

Open-source is one of the most powerful ways to write software and we want to make sure Wasp is freely accessible to every developer.</p><p>Wasp is a technically innovative and challenging project. Even though we are not building a new general programming language from scratch, there still exists an essential complexity of building a language and all the tooling around it. Wasp offers a lot of abstractions that are being introduced for the first time and there is no clear blueprint to follow, and this is why such an undertaking requires full-time attention and dedication.

For function <code>f</code>, it means it is saying &quot;for all types, this function takes that type and returns the same type.&quot;.

Well, obviously to be used with extensions :)!</p><p>The simplest extension is <code>ExplicitForAll</code>, which allows you to explicitly write <code>forall</code> (as we did above).
This is not useful on its own though, since as we said above, explicitly writing <code>forall</code> doesn&#x27;t change anything, it was already implicitly there.</p><p>However, there are other extensions that make use of <code>forall</code> keyword, like: <code>ScopedTypeVariables</code>, <code>RankNTypes</code>, <code>ExistentialQuantification</code>.
All these extensions automatically enable <code>ExplicitForAll</code> extension, which means you don&#x27;t need to enable it yourself when using any of these.
There is also <code>TypeApplications</code> extension which interacts with <code>forall</code> and in that case you might want to use <code>ExplicitForAll</code> with it.</p><p>Since <code>forall</code> is useful only when used with extensions, let&#x27;s take a look at how it is used in each one of those!</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="forall-and-extension-scopedtypevariables"></a><code>forall</code> and extension <a href="https://ghc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/glasgow_exts.html#lexically-scoped-type-variables" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ScopedTypeVariables</a><a class="hash-link" href="#forall-and-extension-scopedtypevariables" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><code>ScopedTypeVariables</code> enables lexical scoping of type variables by explicitly introducing them with <code>forall</code>.</p><p>Let&#x27;s take a look at the following example:</p><div class="codeBlockContainer_K1bP"><div class="codeBlockContent_hGly hs"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-hs codeBlock_23N8 thin-scrollbar" style="color:#bfc7d5;background-color:#292d3e"><code class="codeBlockLines_39YC"><span class="token-line" style="color:#bfc7d5"><span class="token plain">f :: [a] -&gt; [a]</span></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#bfc7d5"><span class="token plain">f xs = ys ++ ys</span></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#bfc7d5"><span class="token plain">  where ys :: [a]</span></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#bfc7d5"><span class="token plain">        ys = reverse xs</span></span></code></pre><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" class="copyButton_Ue-o clean-btn">Copy</button></div></div><p>This code does not compile, because compiler can&#x27;t match type of <code>ys</code> with the return type of <code>f</code>.

Try changing <code>ys :: [a]</code> to <code>ys :: [b]</code> and you will get the exact same error,
because it is exactly the same code -&gt; <code>a</code> in <code>ys :: [a]</code> and <code>a</code> in <code>f :: [a] -&gt; [a]</code> are different <code>a</code>s and there is no connection between them.

On the other hand, <code>bar</code> needs a function that takes value of <strong>some</strong> type and returns the value of that same type, so <code>specificFunc</code> is completely fine since it works only with <code>Int</code>, while <code>polymorphicFunc</code> is also ok although it is more general than what is needed, since compiler can easily specialize it. </p><p>Another example is <code>liftPair</code> function:</p><div class="codeBlockContainer_K1bP"><div class="codeBlockContent_hGly hs"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-hs codeBlock_23N8 thin-scrollbar" style="color:#bfc7d5;background-color:#292d3e"><code class="codeBlockLines_39YC"><span class="token-line" style="color:#bfc7d5"><span class="token plain">liftPair :: (forall x. x -&gt; f x) -&gt; (a, b) -&gt; (f a, f b)</span></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#bfc7d5"><span class="token plain">liftPair func (y, z) = (func y, func z)</span></span></code></pre><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" class="copyButton_Ue-o clean-btn">Copy</button></div></div><div class="codeBlockContainer_K1bP"><div class="codeBlockContent_hGly"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-undefined codeBlock_23N8 thin-scrollbar" style="color:#bfc7d5;background-color:#292d3e"><code class="codeBlockLines_39YC"><span class="token-line" style="color:#bfc7d5"><span class="token plain">&gt;&gt; liftPair (:[]) (1, &quot;a&quot;)</span></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#bfc7d5"><span class="token plain">([1], [&quot;a&quot;])</span></span></code></pre><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" class="copyButton_Ue-o clean-btn">Copy</button></div></div><p><code>liftPair</code> takes polymorphic function and applies it to both values in the pair.

Therefore, <code>read @Int :: String -&gt; Int</code>.</p><p>How does <code>forall</code> come into play here?</p><p>Well, if an identifier’s type signature does not include an explicit <code>forall</code>, the type variable arguments appear in the left-to-right order in which the variables appear in the type. So, <code>foo :: Monad m =&gt; a b -&gt; m (a c)</code> will have its type variables ordered as <code>m</code>, <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, <code>c</code>, and type applications will happen in that order: if we have <code>foo @Maybe @Either</code>, <code>@Maybe</code> will apply to <code>m</code> while <code>@Either</code> will apply to <code>a</code>. However, if you want to force a different order, for example <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, <code>c</code>, <code>m</code>, so that <code>@Maybe</code> in <code>foo @Maybe @Either</code> applies to <code>a</code>, you can refactor the signature as <code>foo :: forall a b c m. Monad m =&gt; a b -&gt; m (a c)</code>, and now order of type variables in <code>forall</code> will be used when doing type applications!</p><p>This will require you to enable <code>ExplicitForAll</code> extension, if it is not already enabled.</p><header><h1>Conclusion</h1></header><p>This document should give a fair idea of how <code>forall</code> is used and what can be done with it, but it doesn&#x27;t go into much depth or cover all of the ways <code>forall</code> is used in Haskell.</p><p>For more in-detail explanations and further investigation, here is a couple of useful resources:</p><ul><li>Great SO question/answers: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3071136/what-does-the-forall-keyword-in-haskell-ghc-do" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3071136/what-does-the-forall-keyword-in-haskell-ghc-do</a> .</li><li>Docs on extensions, which in details describe how each of them works: <a href="https://ghc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/glasgow_exts.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://ghc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/glasgow_exts.html</a> .</li><li><a href="https://ghc.gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/doc/users_guide/exts/explicit_forall.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://ghc.gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/doc/users_guide/exts/explicit_forall.html</a> .</li><li>Article about <code>ST</code> monad that also explains a lot about <code>forall</code>: <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/178243.178246" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/178243.178246</a> . </li></ul><p>This blog post originated from the <a href="https://github.com/wasp-lang/haskell-handbook/blob/35f14951b17f2174cbc269628bea157b6698a9e4/forall.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">notes I wrote in wasp-lang/haskell-handbook</a>.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col col--9"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_2ga9 padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_11ep"><a class="tag_1Okp tagRegular_3MiF" href="/wasp/blog/tags/haskell">haskell</a></li><li class="tag_11ep"><a class="tag_1Okp tagRegular_3MiF" href="/wasp/blog/tags/tutorial">tutorial</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="blogPostTitle_GeHD" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/wasp/blog/2021/04/29/discord-bot-introduction">How to implement a Discord bot (in NodeJS) that requires new members to introduce themselves</a></h2><div class="blogPostData_291c margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-04-29T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">April 29, 2021</time> · 9 min read</div><div class="row margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_1R69"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/martinsos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Martin Sosic</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Co-founder &amp; CTO @ Wasp</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p align="center"></p><figure><img alt="Guest introducing themselves and getting full-access." src="/wasp/img/discord-introduction-example.png"><figcaption>A Guest user getting access by introducing themselves in the &quot;introductions&quot; channel.</figcaption></figure><p></p><p>At <a href="https://wasp-lang.dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wasp</a>, we have a Discord server for our community, where we talk with people interested in and using Wasp - Waspeteers!</p><p>In the beginning, we knew everybody in the community by their name, but as it started growing, we had a lot of people joining that never wrote anything, and the community started feeling less homey, less intimate.</p><p>This was when we decided to make it required for the new members to introduce themselves to gain access to the community.
